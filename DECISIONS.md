# DECISIONS — antimartingal studio

Running log of design decisions. Read before structural edits.

- **D1 (2026-05-29)** — Scope = abstract antimartingale + real-asset ATR port + options view,
  NOT Black-Scholes LEAPS pricing engine (LEAPS plan `bright-weaving-marshmallow.md` superseded).
- **D2** — Win/loss resolution = **weekly entry + daily intra-week race**, barriers **fixed at
  entry** (B-1), single-day straddle = **loss-first** (B-2). Resolves the A-vs-B ambiguity.
- **D3** — Data: daily from yfinance (stooq fallback), weekly via resample. Daily is the finest
  interval with full free history; intraday windows too short for multi-decade backtest.
- **D4** — Account model = **cash + optional cap** (`cap_mult`), not margin (Q3).
- **D5** — Tab 3 options: **configurable DTE** (slider, default 365), strike chosen by
  **target delta** (default 0.95, deep-ITM), IV = **realized volatility** of the asset.
- **D6** — Sizing: 1·ATR move == `base_bet`. Linear tab: win=+bet, loss=−bet. Options tab:
  `units = bet/ATR`, P&L from BS reprice; premium floor truncates the left tail (the doctrine's
  loss-side lever → +EV vs the linear instrument).
- **D7** — Cache via **pickle** (no pyarrow/parquet engine dependency).
- **D8** — `resolve_trials` advances to the next week by **week-start date**, not the Friday
  label (fixed an infinite-loop bug where the current week's label > the in-week exit date).

## Web / deployment / TradingView (2026-05-29)
- **D9** — Web stack = **FastAPI (JSON API) + static Plotly SPA**, not Streamlit/Dash (user choice).
  Math core stays transport-agnostic; web layer only adds transport/validation/serialization.
- **D10** — Deploy = **Docker, maximally portable** (no platform lock-in): `deploy/Dockerfile`
  (lean `requirements-web.txt`, non-root, gunicorn+uvicorn workers, healthcheck) +
  `docker-compose.yml`. Platform configs (render/fly) deferred until a target is chosen.
- **D11** — **Stateless** API → horizontal scale by replicas; `WEB_CONCURRENCY` for workers.
  Shared state behind interfaces: `SignalStore` (SQLite→Postgres), price cache (pickle→Redis).
- **D12** — **TradingView seam**: a strategy is a *signal generator*; we overlay antimartingale
  sizing. `tradingview.parse_alert` → `signals.SignalStore` → `signals_to_trials` → `run_linear`.
  Webhook `/api/webhook/tradingview` authed by `ANTIMG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (header or body passphrase).
- **D13** — Signal classification: alert `outcome`=win/loss, or sign of `pnl`. Entry/exit pairing
  of separate alerts = future extension (noted in `signals.py`).
- **D14** — Anti-DoS caps in `web/config.py` (max_iterations, max_target_streak, max_points
  downsampling), all env-tunable. Series downsampled so 30y daily history is a light payload.

## Mirror-hedge (rejected, see SKILL.md)
Antimartingale-long + martingale-short on the SAME instrument resizes in lockstep
(`bet_long ≡ bet_short`) ⇒ net exposure 0 ⇒ deterministic zero gross, costs make it negative.
Not implemented; documented as a rejected tactic.

## Cost model + cost-as-probability (2026-05-29)
- **D15** — Transaction costs: BOTH commission and slippage are **% of position notional
  per fill, charged on entry AND exit (×2 round-trip)**; notional=(bet/ATR)*price.
  (Superseded the earlier $/fill commission + `slippage_frac` model — user wanted both in %.)
  Tracked as separate cumulative curves (commission, slippage, total) plotted on the equity
  chart on a SECONDARY axis alongside net vs gross equity.
- **D16** — Cost expressed as a win-probability drag Δp via the breakeven shift:
  no-cost breakeven p=0.5; with avg cost κ/cycle, (2p*)^N = 1+κ/b ⇒ p*=0.5·(1+κ/b)^(1/N).
  Δp=p*−0.5 = "how much win-prob the cost eats"; if edge (p−0.5) < Δp the strategy is net −EV.
  Reported per-component (commission/slippage) and total; UI shows a ✓/✗ verdict vs the edge.

## Options resolution fixed: no stop + per-trial table (2026-05-29)
- **D17** — A LONG CALL has **no −1·ATR stop** (downside = premium). New
  `resolve_trials_long_call`: hold through pullbacks; WIN = price reaches +1·ATR before
  expiry, LOSS = expiry (entry+DTE) without the target. The options tab uses THIS, not the
  linear whipsaw stops. Demonstrated: SPY 2010–2026 linear p≈0.58 vs option p≈0.98 — the
  call captures the up-move far more often (the whole point the user flagged).
- **D18** — Detailed per-trial table under both backtest charts (`res.table`): entry/exit,
  prices, ATR, barriers/target, exit reason, outcome, bet/cost/pnl/bank; options add strike,
  premium in/out, delta in/out, units, option P&L. Static assets versioned (?v=N) + no-cache
  on the app shell so redeploys are always picked up.

## Campaign engine: scale-into-one-position on ATR grid (2026-05-29)
- **D19** — Backtest engine rewritten to `run_campaign`: scale into ONE position on the ATR
  grid. Lot ladder ×2 (1,2,4,8…), weighted avg entry, trailing stop S=avg−h/Q (h=mult·ATR)
  so the whole stack's loss is capped at the initial b → every stop-out ≈ −b, every
  target-N run = big convex win = the coin-flip distribution. `mode`: pyramid (scale-in) |
  scalp (book +b each step). Both backtest tabs use it: instrument='shares' (linear) /
  'calls' (BS-repriced, delta-normalised units=(b/h)/Δ_entry so 1 lot ≈ b/step regardless of
  delta; IV fixed at entry). Verified SPY 2010–: shares median loss = exactly −b, rare huge
  wins; calls fatten the win tail via gamma. Delta slider (default 0.5) + per-campaign table
  (steps/lots_Q/avg/stop/gross/pnl). Old run_linear/run_options/resolve_trials kept (tests).

## Real implied vol (VIX) + option rolling (2026-05-29)
- **D20** — Option IV input: `iv_source` = auto|vix|realized|constant. **auto/vix uses ^VIX**
  (real historical market IMPLIED vol, free) for S&P tickers — realized vol understated
  premiums badly (e.g. 2020 ATM 365d: $8 realized vs $15 VIX). Δ=0.5 strike barely moves,
  but premium/theta become market-real → option P&L is honest (lower). Non-S&P → realized
  vol fallback (no free vol index). Brainstormer "colleague" used intrinsic+rule-of-thumb,
  not real chains — our BS+VIX is strictly more rigorous. Caveat: VIX is 30d ATM, used flat
  (no term structure, no skew).
- **D21** — Auto-roll: when a held call is within `roll_buffer_days` (default 5) of expiry and
  the campaign is still open, roll = crystallise + re-strike to target_delta at current price
  for a fresh DTE, same lot exposure; each roll leg pays commission+slippage. Lets short/weekly
  DTE ride the trend (verified: weekly 7d → ~265 rolls). `_calls_campaign_pnl` is MTM with rolls.

## Pyramid-on-options bugfix + honest profitability (2026-05-30)
- **D22** — `run_campaign` calls path used to force-close each campaign at the option's expiry
  (`d >= expiry_day`). With short DTE that fired in week 1 before price moved +1·ATR, so the
  ladder never built (lots_Q≡1) and D21's rolling was dead code. **Removed the campaign-level
  expiry exit**: a finite option life is handled solely by ROLLING; the campaign exits only on
  stop/target/open (same as shares). Verified lots_Q ∈ {1,3,7,15,31}.
- **D23** — The campaign is NOT a fair coin-flip; its `empirical_p` is the campaign target-hit
  rate (~0.11), NOT a per-step win prob. So the coin-flip `edge = p−0.5` / breakeven-`p*`
  readout (D16) is **meaningless for the campaign** (reported fake −EV on profitable runs).
  UI now shows a plain PROFITABILITY VERDICT: net P&L, profit factor, win/loss counts+averages.
  `cost_as_prob`/`breakeven_p_with_cost` kept in the payload but no longer drive a verdict.
- **D24** — Price chart shows a green triangle-up at every +1·ATR scale-in (`entries.add`);
  target win = gold star, stop loss = red down-triangle.
- Empirical (SPY 2015–26, base $100, target 4, costs on): shares +$22.8k PF2.9; deep-ITM LEAPS
  (DTE365, Δ0.9, real VIX) +$18.3k PF2.2; **weekly DTE7 Δ0.5 calls at real VIX bleed theta to
  −$20.2k** — the data-driven case for the doctrine's deep-ITM low-theta LEAPS.

## Vol surface: term structure + skew + non-S&P indices (2026-05-30)
- **D25** — New `src/antimg/vol.py` `VolModel`: IV is a surface, not a flat number.
  **Term structure** from real CBOE constant-maturity vol indices (S&P: ^VIX9D/^VIX/^VIX3M/
  ^VIX6M) interpolated to the option's tenor in **variance-time** (linear in σ²·T), flat-σ
  extrapolation outside. `use_term_structure=False` → nearest tenor, flat in T.
- **D26** — **Non-S&P vol indices** by asset class: ^VXN (nasdaq), ^RVX (russell), ^VXD (dow),
  ^GVZ (gold), ^OVX (oil), ^EVZ (eurusd); else realized-vol fallback. (Replaces the old
  "VIX for S&P, realized for everything else".) `iv_source` adds `index`; `auto` picks the
  class index then falls back to realized.
- **D27** — **Skew** = additive `σ(m) = σ_atm + β·ln(K/S)`, fixed β per asset class (equity
  smirk β<0: SPY −0.18, QQQ −0.16; gold −0.05; FX −0.03; other −0.10), overridable via UI
  `skew_beta`. With a Δ-target the strike is off-ATM, so the smile shifts the premium:
  deep-ITM (K<S) picks up the smirk. β=0 = pure ATM (prior behaviour). β is a calibration
  (a slider), NOT market data — kept explicit/simple, no full smile fit.
- Wiring: `run_campaign`/`_calls_campaign_pnl` take optional `vol_model`; strike solved at the
  ATM term IV, option priced/repriced at the skew-adjusted IV (entry + every roll). Options
  payload reports `vol_model`/`vol_class`/`skew_beta`. Verified skew monotone (β0 +$24.1k →
  β−0.4 +$20.8k); GLD→index:gold, QQQ→index:nasdaq. assets ?v=10. 43 tests green.

## Coin-flip chart fix (2026-05-30)
- **D28** — Coin-flip UI restyle. The backend (`simcore.Simulation.simulate`) was already
  correct: `history` is the per-TRIAL bank path (multi-point, NOT a single dot — an earlier
  commit message wrongly claimed a "single point" bug; that diagnosis was mistaken and the
  attempted simcore rewrite never applied). The real defect was the UI: a leftover commit
  briefly wired the coin-flip stats block to NON-EXISTENT keys (`empirical_ev_per_cycle`,
  `win_rate`) → stats rendered as "—"/NaN. Corrected to the actual API keys: `final_bank`,
  `cycles`, `successes`, `ev_cycle_empirical`, `ev_cycle_theory`, `trades_per_cycle`. UI now
  shows a verdict line (📈/📉/➖ + final P&L over N cycles, empirical vs closed-form EV/cycle,
  target-hit %), the equity curve filled green/red by sign ("cycle/trial #" axis) and the
  streak chart relabelled. assets ?v=13. No backend/test changes (simcore untouched).
  Also fixed earlier this session (v11): app.js failed to parse — duplicate `const loss`
  (verdict block vs chart trace) broke the whole page; renamed to winSum/lossSum.
  **Lesson: always check the real API payload keys before binding the UI to them, and
  `node --check` app.js after every edit.**

## Black-Scholes speedup (2026-06-01)
- **D29** — Swapped `scipy.stats.norm.cdf` → `scipy.special.ndtr` in `options.py` (`call_delta`,
  `call_price`). `ndtr` IS the standard-normal CDF without the frozen-distribution object
  overhead: `norm.cdf` ≈ 37.7 µs/scalar call vs `ndtr` ≈ 0.1 µs (**377×**). Because every BS
  primitive runs inside 64–80-iteration bisection loops (`strike_for_delta`, `price_for_value`)
  called per round/per bar, this is the dominant cost. **Numerically identical** — max |Δprice|
  and |Δdelta| over a 500-point random grid = exactly 0.0; solver residuals at 1e-15.
  Micro: `call_price` 84→5.7 µs (14.8×), `strike_for_delta` 3.7→0.37 ms (10×),
  `price_for_value` 5.5→0.38 ms (14.5×). End-to-end coin-flip engine on synthetic trend
  (54 cycles): **0.98s → 0.10s, 9.5×, identical final_bank** ⇒ the ~2-min 81-ticker coin-flip
  scan should drop to ~12–15s. 51 tests green, no behaviour change. Motivates the next-step
  p-sweep (which re-runs the engine many times — now affordable).

## Scan honesty: drift-stripped control + breakeven IV markup + fixed verdict (2026-06-01)
- **D30** — Made Tab 5 (Scan) stop flattering the strategy. Three parts:
  1. **Verdict fix (app.js):** the old footnote "mean ≫ median ⇒ NOT sound" printed UNCONDITIONALLY
     (even when mean≈median, contradicting the "✅ BROADLY ROBUST" badge). Now: badge requires BOTH
     ≥50% profitable AND median > 0; the mean≫median and median≤0 caveats are conditional.
  2. **Drift-stripped control (`stress=True`):** `_detrend(daily)` removes the mean daily log-return
     (zero net drift = a true fair coin) keeping vol/intraweek shape, and re-runs the SAME strategy.
     Per-instrument `control_ret_pct` + aggregate `control_median_ret_pct`/`control_profitable_pct`.
     The gap (real − control) is the part that's pure directional drift, not structure. Demo on a
     +10%/yr synthetic: base −6.2% vs control −28.8% ⇒ 22.7pp was drift.
  3. **Breakeven IV markup (coinflip, `stress=True`):** `_breakeven_markup` bisects (net is monotone-
     decreasing in markup) the IV markup at which net=0, in [0.5,3.0], with lo/hi flags. "Options must
     be priced below Nx realized to profit." Demo: 1.22× ⇒ real options (~1.1–1.6×) make it −EV.
  - `ScanReq.stress` opt-in (~3–8× slower); gunicorn `--timeout 120→600` so the stress sweep isn't
    killed. assets ?v=27. 53 tests (added `_detrend` zero-drift invariant + stress-fields test).
  - **WHY:** answering "is 5-in-a-row calls profitable?" — a synthetic zero-drift fair coin reproduced
    the user's ~67%/+28% scan ONLY when +10%/yr drift was injected; at markup 1.25 a fair coin LOSES
    (−33% median). The broad positivity was drift + fill/IV optimism, not a structural edge. These
    controls surface that in the tool itself.

## Scan control fix: drift/trend/floor decomposition via IID shuffle (2026-06-01)
- **D31** — The drift-strip control (D30) was shown to be a BAD test: it removes only the mean
  log-return, leaving the path order (so trends survive) AND over-correcting trending series into a
  back-half reversal (SPY detrend −16k < shuffle +9k — nonsensical). Replaced it with an IID SHUFFLE
  surrogate (`_shuffle_surrogate`: permute per-day bar shapes — logret + hi/lo/open wicks in lockstep
  — destroying serial structure, keeping the exact bar distribution; `keep_drift` toggles zeroing the
  mean). `stress=True` now runs `shuffle_n` (default 8) shuffles in two modes and reports an ADDITIVE
  3-way split per instrument that telescopes to base net:
    floor = E[net | IID, zero drift]            (noise/fill-artifact; doctrine says ≈0)
    drift = E[net | IID, real drift] − floor     (1st-moment directional component)
    trend = base − E[net | IID, real drift]      (serial structure: momentum/trend persistence)
  Naive detrend kept as a labelled reference (over-corrects — don't trust it). Aggregate medians +
  floor-profitable% + be_markup_median in summary. gunicorn timeout 600→900.
  - **Result on real SPY/QQQ/GLD (12 shuffles):** profit is DRIFT-dominated (SPY drift +38k of +70k;
    QQQ +52k of +46k; GLD +70k of +13.5k). Trend/momentum is INCONSISTENT (SPY +20k but QQQ −16k,
    GLD −56k — time-ordering HURTS gold/nasdaq). Floor ≈ 0 within ~1 sd everywhere (GLD +205). ⇒ the
    structure manufactures no edge; the scan's headline is a levered directional long, not structural
    alpha. Confirms the original verdict; the drift-check "not changing" was the control being broken.
  - assets ?v=28. 54 tests (+shuffle surrogate props + additive-identity check). Verdict text now
    splits the median headline into trend/drift/floor with interpretation.

## Make option rolling visible + add rolling model to Tab 7 (2026-06-01)
- **D32** — User: «I don't see option rolling in Tab 7; I only see the loss when it expires.» Correct on
  both counts. (a) Tab 7 Inspect only offered shares + coinflip; the coinflip model has NO within-round
  roll by design (hold to double-or-expiry) so a losing round books its loss only AT expiry — exactly
  what they saw. (b) The auto-roll (re-strike to target-Δ within roll_buffer_days of expiry, keep
  exposure, ride the trend) lives ONLY in the pyramid-calls model (`run_campaign instrument='calls'` →
  `_calls_campaign_pnl`), which Inspect didn't expose; and even where it ran (Tab 3) the roll was never
  emitted as a trace event — only counted in `row['rolls']`, hence invisible.
  - Engine: `_calls_campaign_pnl` now emits a distinct **`opt_roll`** trace event (camp, n, date, spot,
    old→new strike, old→new expiry, prem_close/open, contracts, roll_cost).
  - API: `InspectReq.model` gains **`calls`** (pyramid + auto-roll, realized-vol IV) + `roll_buffer_days`;
    `/api/inspect` runs it (instrument='calls') and returns roll_buffer_days.
  - Frontend: Inspect Strategy dropdown gets «calls — pyramid + auto-roll 🔁» + a Roll-buffer input;
    `_inspCampGrid` passes instrument through so calls campaigns render the options path; roll markers
    (cyan diamonds, old→new strike labels) on both the window overview and the per-campaign chart; a
    «🔁 АВТО-РОЛЛ» narration block + roll rows in the options ledger; roll count in the window summary.
  - Verified real SPY 2020-22 DTE45: 8 opt_roll events = the 8 campaign rolls; rolled strikes re-struck
    to spot, expiry +~6 weeks. assets ?v=29. 55 tests (+calls-inspect roll test, +calls case in inspect test).

## TradingView closed loop: open/close pairing + GET /api/next-bet (2026-06-01)
- **D33** — Implemented the documented TradingView extension (ARCHITECTURE.md «Future extension»):
  the connection was ingest+replay only; now it's a **closed loop**.
  1. **Open/close pairing** (`signals.signals_to_trials`): besides self-contained closed-trade alerts
     (pnl/outcome → one Trial, unchanged), a buy/sell OPEN alert (price, no outcome) is now held and
     PAIRED with the next close/exit/flat alert on the same (strategy_id, ticker) — outcome inferred
     from the price move and side (long: close≥open ⇒ win; short inverted), entry/exit = the two prices.
  2. **Live sizing** (`atr_strategy.pyramid_state` + `GET /api/next-bet`): replays the stored win/loss
     stream through the antimartingale state machine (2× on a win capped at base·cap_mult, reset on a
     loss or a booked target streak) and returns `next_bet` (+ streak/wins/losses/mult/note). A Pine
     alert reads this back — `GET /api/next-bet?strategy_id=&base_bet=&target_streak=&cap_mult=` — to
     size its next order from the running streak. Pure read, no mutation; fresh strategy → base_bet.
  - Verified: 3 wins (cap 8) → next_bet 800 (8×); a loss → reset to base; open+close pair → win/loss.
  - Tab 4 gets a «🎯 Next bet (live)» button + the hint documents pairing & the closed loop. assets ?v=30.
  - 58 tests (+pyramid_state, +next-bet endpoint, +open/close pairing). ARCHITECTURE.md updated (status →
    implemented incl. pairing + next-bet).

## Tab 8 — Hedged Intraday (Прикрытый Интрадей, Korovin) backtest (2026-06-04)
- **D34** — New tab + engine for a DIFFERENT strategy family (not antimartingale): the ПИ method
  (`/hedgedintraday` skill). Built per a live consult of the corpus (`5fada65b`) on backtest modeling.
  - **Position** = long synthetic **straddle (2 ATM calls − 1 future)**, delta-neutral, long gamma,
    max loss = premium. BS mark-to-market daily (IV from `vol.VolModel` term-structure/skew, same as
    Tab 3), rolled to a fresh ATM strike within `roll_buffer_days` of expiry (monthly DTE default).
    Premium budget = `risk_pct`·bank (doctrine 20%), re-sized to the running bank at each roll.
  - **Scalping overlay** = counter-trend exponential grid (three-thirds: intraday limit = `intraday_frac`
    of futures, `n_parts`, first step `grid_atr_frac`·dailyATR, `grid_mult` spacing). Daily-bar model:
    `scalp_day = part_lots·(min(max_rt·g1, eff·reversed_range) − stuck_penalty·max(0,|C−O|−g1))`,
    `reversed_range = (H−L)−|C−O|` (the mean-reverting part the grid harvests; trend portion drags).
  - **Engine**: `src/antimg/hedged_intraday.py::run_hedged_intraday` → separated **straddle / scalp /
    total** P&L streams + a modeled theta path + per-straddle-period table. `POST /api/hedged-intraday`
    (`HedgedIntradayReq`). Tab 8 plots the P&L decomposition + price-with-rolls and an honest verdict
    (CAGR vs the doctrine's 25–40%/yr; % of theta the scalp covered; worst-period vs premium cap).
  - **Honesty (key)**: daily bars see ~1 reversal/day vs the corpus's ~10 RT/day on 1-min → scalp is a
    PESSIMISTIC LOWER BOUND, theta dominates. Default eff=0.5 recovers ~14% of theta on SPY/GLD 2018-26
    — which MATCHES Korovin's own "students offset 10–15% of straddle cost/month" figure (calibration
    check). Monthly ATM straddles bled (~−32% CAGR) under this conservative daily model; lifting
    `scalp_efficiency`/`max_rt_per_day` approximates intraday frequency. Verdict states all this; lesson
    written back to the skill (`references/lessons.md::backtest-daily-bars`).
  - Verified: SPY/GLD real-data smoke (worst period ≥ −premium = the loss cap holds; identity
    total = bank + straddle + scalp). assets ?v=33. 64 tests (+5 engine, +1 web). 8 tabs now.

## Tab 8 bulk scan — ПИ across the whole catalog (2026-06-04)
- **D35** — Added a one-click cross-instrument sweep for the Hedged Intraday strategy (parallels
  Tab 5 «Scan all» but for ПИ). New `HedgedIntradayScanReq` (the ПИ knobs minus ticker/end — too
  different from shares/coinflip to bolt onto `ScanReq`) + `POST /api/hedged-intraday/scan`: runs
  `run_hedged_intraday` on every `instruments.flat_with_group()` ticker with identical params,
  sequential (Yahoo 429), per-ticker failures captured. Per-row summary (`_hi_summary`): net,
  ret%, **CAGR**, straddle/scalp split, scalp-cover%, worst-period, premium cap, **loss_cap_ok**
  (worst period ≥ −premium), maxDD, rolls. Aggregate: profitable%, median/mean CAGR, median
  scalp-cover, loss-cap-ok%, best/worst.
  - Refactored `_build_vol(req, daily, ticker=None)` to take a ticker override (scan has no single
    ticker) and extracted `_run_hi(daily, datr, vm, realized, req)` shared by the single route + scan.
  - Tab 8 frontend: «📊 Bulk» button reusing the same form params (ticker/end ignored server-side),
    its own sortable results table (`renderHiScanTable`, default sort CAGR desc) + horizontal CAGR
    bar + verdict (robust if ≥50% profitable AND median CAGR>0; restates the daily-bar lower-bound
    caveat). assets ?v=34. 65 tests (+scan web test).

## Tab 8 — event-driven daily-cadence scalp grid (user insight) (2026-06-04)
- **D36** — User: «absence of intraday data should not prevent backtest — take 6mo/1yr options, then
  one-day data is representative because the range is much bigger [relative to the grid step]». Correct.
  Reframed the scalp from a lower-bound heuristic to a FAITHFUL daily-cadence simulation.
  - New default `scalp_model='grid'`: event-driven counter-trend grid. Grid step g1 = grid_atr_frac·dailyATR
    (default 1×), exponential offsets from the straddle center. Each daily bar is walked along an OHLC
    path (green O→L→H→C, red O→H→L→C); resting limit orders fill when crossed; a short at a sell-level
    buys back one step lower (long mirror); each working part holds ≤1 leg ⇒ total ≤ intraday limit
    (never naked); genuinely stuck legs are carried + MtM'd, closed at the roll. NO efficiency/RT/penalty
    fudge — removed three knobs from the honest path. `scalp_round_trips` counted + surfaced.
  - Legacy `scalp_model='range'` kept (the old (H−L)−|C−O| heuristic) as the explicit intraday lower bound.
  - Defaults shifted to the slow regime: dte_days 30→180, roll_buffer 5→10, grid_atr_frac 0.5→1.0.
  - **Real-data validation (2018-26): long DTE collapses theta bleed** — GLD monthly −24.7%/yr →
    grid+1yr −1.7%/yr; SPY −35% → −4.3%; SLV +20.7%(range,optimistic) → +0.8%(grid,1yr). Grid books
    70–110 real round-trips; counter-trend scalp ~washes (small trend drag, straddle gamma pays theta)
    ⇒ net ≈ breakeven, not catastrophic bleed. Daily bars ARE representative in this regime.
  - Engine/schema/scan all thread `scalp_model`; Tab 8 + bulk verdicts branch on it (grid = "daily
    representative, read CAGR directly"; range = "lower bound"). assets ?v=36. 67 tests (+2 grid).
  - Lesson → skill `references/lessons.md::daily-bars-representative-with-long-options`.

## Tab 8 — grid-step ATR timeframe (daily/weekly/monthly) (2026-06-04)
- **D37** — User insight: to scalp a wider oscillation that daily bars CAN resolve, base the grid
  STEP on a longer-timeframe ATR (weekly/monthly) so each daily bar is sub-step "intraday-like"
  info within a multi-day swing. New `grid_timeframe` (daily|weekly|monthly, default **weekly**);
  `data.atr_on_timeframe()` computes ATR on the coarse bar, SHIFTS one bar (no look-ahead),
  ffill-reindexes to daily. Execution still walks daily bars. Also added `data.monthly()`.
  - **Real-data (DTE 365): coarser TF turns the quiet doctrine instruments positive** — GLD
    −1.7%(daily)→+4.2%(monthly); SLV +0.8→+7.7; GC −2.0→+4.5; NG −4.5→+3.9. **Honest mechanism:**
    NOT more scalp (scalp stays ~flat/slightly-neg) — the wide grid TRADES FAR LESS (RT/yr ~9→1),
    stops over-churning/fighting trends, and lets the STRADDLE carry (the doctrine's "flatten the
    grid, bigger targets, once-a-day" mode). Straddle remains the engine; the reframe removes the
    daily grid's self-inflicted cost+trend drag. (CAGR shifts also partly via bank-compounding
    coupling: less scalp drag → bigger bank → bigger straddle sizing.)

    68 tests (+grid-timeframe widening test).

## Tab 8 — straddle breakeven-theta-coverage readout + DTE default 365 (2026-06-04)
- **D38** — User: "SPY should be positive and is not" (range −7%, grid −13%). Diagnosed honestly:
  SPY's straddle gamma+directional is strongly POSITIVE (+4.7–5.3k — it catches the big moves);
  theta (−6.4–8k) only just exceeds it, so the straddle is a hair below breakeven. Net=0 needs the
  scalp to cover only ~17–33% of theta — far below the doctrine's MINIMUM scalp claim (~100%,
  «отбивание теты»). ⇒ under the method's design intent SPY IS positive; the daily backtest shows
  negative only because the grid books ≈0 scalp (can't see SPY's intraday chop) and DTE 180 piled
  on theta. (range model DTE 365 already shows SPY +1.4%.)
  - Engine exposes `gamma_dir_pnl` (straddle − theta) and `breakeven_scalp_cover_pct`
    (= −straddle/|theta|, the % of theta the scalp must cover for net=0). Verdict now leads the
    decomposition with: gamma vs theta split + "straddle is ~breakeven; scalp needs X% of theta;
    doctrine min ≈100% ⇒ instrument positive under design intent." Surfaced in /api/hedged-intraday.
  - Default `dte_days` 180→365 (the user's "even one year"): slower theta, straddle closer to
    breakeven on indices. assets ?v=40. 68 tests.
  - Live consult on SPY/index suitability QUEUED (NotebookLM rate-limited).

## Tab 8 — scalp grid re-centering (frozen-grid bug fix) (2026-06-04)
- **D39** — User spotted the real bug: the scalp grid was anchored at the straddle strike and frozen
  for the whole option life (a year at DTE 365), so once price trended away it stopped scalping the
  current range entirely (→ ~0 round-trips). Fix: `scalp_recenter_days` (default 21) re-centers the
  grid to the CURRENT price every N days (realizing stuck legs), so it follows price and scalps the
  live range. Defaults shifted to the user's "2× daily ATR target": grid_timeframe daily,
  grid_atr_frac 2.0, recenter 21; engine dte_days 180→365.
  - **Honest measured outcome:** re-centering REDUCES the frozen-grid trend-bleed (ETH scalp
    −18.8k→−8.3k, CAGR 24.9%→28%; GLD/SLV/NG scalp losses cut toward ~0) — kept ON by default. BUT
    it does NOT manufacture scalp income: round-trips/yr stay ~5 whether frozen or tracking, coarse
    or fine step. CONFIRMS the hard limit: live ПИ's ~2500 round-trips/yr are TINY intraday wiggles
    (smaller than daily ATR) that an OHLC bar discards; the ≥2·ATR swings a daily bar CAN see are
    rare (~5/yr) and usually don't cleanly reverse (trend). So the daily backtest still measures the
    straddle core, not the scalp — the scalp needs intraday data. (Where the user's "2× daily ATR
    catches all the back-and-forth" overestimates: the profitable scalp is sub-daily, not big swings.)
  - assets ?v=41. 68 tests.

## Tab 8 — many fine sub-parts: count rises, P&L doesn't (2026-06-04)
- **D40** — User: the ⅓ scalp limit can be split into many sub-parts, each deblocked only when price
  travels its (exponential) distance. Confirmed the grid ALREADY does this (cumulative-exponential
  levels, distance-gated fill, re-arm after round-trip). Raised n_parts cap 10→50 so it can be split
  fine. **Measured: more sub-parts raise the round-trip COUNT a lot (SPY 19→239/yr, SLV 15→195/yr at
  40 parts / 0.2×ATR step) — approaching live ПИ frequency — but net scalp P&L does NOT improve**
  (SPY scalp −201→−494, SLV −399→−464). Reason: profit/round-trip ∝ step, so finer parts just slice
  the SAME daily-resolvable mean-reversion into smaller pieces (more trips × smaller size ≈ same
  gross), and trends still drag at every scale. Live ПИ's ~2500 trips/yr profit because they're
  INTRADAY (many reversals WITHIN each day = large intraday path length) — exactly what a daily OHLC
  bar discards. So sub-part count can't recover the scalp edge from daily data; it's bounded by the
  path's mean-reversion content at the daily scale. Same conclusion, new angle.

## Tab 8 — BUG FIX: re-centering destroyed the mean-reversion edge (2026-06-04)
- **D41** — User challenged that ПИ has positive expectation yet the model loses, suspecting a rule
  violation. Investigation found a REAL bug I introduced in D39: `scalp_recenter_days` force-closes
  open scalp legs to market on a timer — which REALIZES the underwater counter-trend legs that were
  about to mean-revert, converting the edge into losses (and violating the doctrine "carry/heal stuck
  parts, never abandon"). Proof: a clean OU mean-reverter flips +933 (carry) → −602 (re-center);
  detrended SPY −329→+77, detrended GLD −176→+80. **Fix: default scalp_recenter_days 21→0** (carry
  stuck legs to the roll — the doctrine-faithful behavior that lets the grid capture mean-reversion);
  re-centering kept as an opt-in but documented as edge-destroying. +OU regression test (69 tests).
  - **Resolved the scale-invariance question honestly:** ПИ is NOT unconditional-positive-EV. The
    scalp = gamma-scalping the straddle; its edge = capturing mean-reversion, which is SCALE- and
    instrument-DEPENDENT. SPY daily returns mean-revert (lag-1 autocorr −0.13) so the edge EXISTS,
    but at the daily scale it's small and competes with DRIFT (stuck-leg losses on the multi-week
    trend). Detrended → scalp positive on SPY/GLD; with drift → ~0/negative. Crypto (ETH/BTC):
    volatile but TRENDING (10x) → counter-trend scalp LOSES (−19k) while the straddle GAMMA WINS
    (+72k) — opposite sides of the trend BY DESIGN (the straddle is the hedge of the scalp's trend
    risk). So "volatile = back-and-forth = scalp profits" conflates volatility with mean-reversion.

## Tab 9 — ПИ Execution viewer + "don't fade a trend" rule (Bollinger gate) (2026-06-04)
- **D42** — User: apply ALL the basic rules (skill references, not live consult), and add a tab to
  WATCH the strategy on a chosen window. Two parts:
  1. **Applied the missing rule** — *don't fade a confirmed trend*: a Bollinger-band FLAT detector
     gates new counter-trend scalp entries (no short above the upper band / long below the lower
     band; exits always allowed) → on a breakout the grid steps aside and lets the straddle run.
     Engine: `use_bbands`(default on)/`bb_window`(20)/`bb_k`(2). Helps modestly (a trailing band
     drifts with the trend, so it only blocks extreme breakouts): SOL scalp −345k→−306k, SLV +43→+391.
  2. **Tab 9 "ПИ Execution"** + `POST /api/hedged-intraday/inspect` (engine `trace=` emits every
     scalp open/close): pick instrument+window (default 3-mo), see price + BB flat-band + ATM strike
     step + each 🔻short/🔺long scalp entry + ○ exit + ◆ roll + the P&L decomposition, with a
     narrative that reads the regime. Verified SOL 2021-H1: scalp opened 10 shorts into the rally,
     7 stuck, scalp −10.5k, but straddle GAMMA +81.9k → TOTAL +71k — the user's thesis on screen
     ("trend like hell ⇒ positive despite the stuck ⅓; scalp & straddle are opposite sides of the
     trend by design"). 70 tests. assets ?v=44.
  - Process note (user): the corpus is for things OUTSIDE the strategy; the strategy rules are in
    the skill refs — APPLY them, don't ping a rate-limited corpus for what's already documented.

## Tab 8/9 — залипшие части rule (profit-gated heal) + regime visualization (2026-06-04)
- **D43** — User: "how do you decide WHEN to drop which working parts? + show your flat/trend logic on
  the Tab 9 chart." Implemented the doctrine's залипшие-части rule properly and made it visible.
  - **Engine:** `heal_with_profit`(on) + `confident_flat_n`(3). When price leaves the WHOLE grid
    (|price−center|>reach) the stuck parts are HEALED — closed & the grid re-centered to current price —
    **only if accumulated round-trip profit (`heal_budget`) covers the realized loss**; otherwise CARRY
    (straddle pays). `clean_streak` counts consecutive clean round-trips → «уверенный флет» at ≥N
    (scaling allowed); reset on heal/stuck. Emits `scalp_heal` + `confident_flat` trace events;
    result gains `scalp_heals`, `confident_flat_days`. This is the answer to "when to drop a part":
    spend accrued profit to unstick, else let the straddle pay — never force-realize (that was the
    D41 bug). OU regression still green.
  - **Tab 9 viz:** trend-regime spans (price OUTSIDE BB) shaded red = grid steps aside; white = flat
    (scalp active); green dotted verticals = «уверенный флет» reached; ✚ = a heal (with the loss it
    spent). Endpoint returns trend_spans/heals/confident_flat + stats. Reverted the scalp to a single
    shared P&L axis on Tab 8 & 9 (user: dual axis was confusing). Verified SOL 2021: 19 trend-spans,
    0 heals (no profit → carried, straddle paid +321k → total +244k). 70 tests. assets ?v=46.
  - Profitability verdict stated plainly to user: NOT broadly profitable as a daily-measurable backtest
    (28% of panel, 33% of even target instruments, negative medians); profit concentrates in strong
    trenders (crypto) via straddle gamma; the scalp that would carry ranging names is unmeasurable on
    daily bars. Conditionally profitable on the right (volatile/trending) instruments, not universally.

## Tab 8/9 — LITERAL three-thirds (no substitution) (2026-06-04)
- **D45** — User: "do it exactly like the strategy, no improvisation" (re the ⚠ three-thirds). I had
  substituted gamma for the trend reserve and ⅓-of-futures for ⅓-of-calls. Replaced with the literal
  doctrine: total calls = 2·n_str split in thirds — base hedge = ⅓ of calls = (2/3)·n_str short
  futures (the 33% floor), ⅓ of calls left UNHEDGED = trend reserve (net-long at rest → trend runs by
  itself), ⅓ of calls = scalp limit. Futures-sold band = exactly 33% (base only) … 67% (full scalp).
  Engine: `base_futs=(2/3)·n_str` used in straddle MtM + all fill notionals; scalp `lim=2·n_str·intraday_frac`.
  - **Following it literally MATTERED** (validates the user): the unhedged trend-reserve third turns
    GLD −1.9%→+4.0%, SLV→+6.2%, SPY −4%→−1%, SOL +130% — the reserve runs with the move as doctrine
    says ("the untouched third drags into profit on a real trend"). Loss cap still holds (worst case =
    flat expiry = −premium; net-long doesn't raise max loss). OU + loss-cap tests green; +band test.
  - Panel: three-thirds ⚠→✅. Remaining ⚠ (literal next): confident-flat LOT SCALING (detect→scale),
    conditional rolling (move≥call-cost + profit, not schedule). assets ?v=49. 71 tests.
  - LESSON: implement doctrine LITERALLY; substituting an "equivalent" mechanism (gamma for the
    unhedged reserve) changed the result and was wrong. Folded into the skill habit.

## Tab 9 — show the ⅓-third split into N working parts + fix the first-step calibration (2026-06-04)
- **D46** — User: "the ⅓ scalp third must then be split into 5 working parts — did you miss that?"
  No — `setup_grid` already splits the intraday third into `n_parts` (default 5) working parts at
  exponential offsets, part_lots = limit/n_parts. BUT the OLD default first step (grid_atr_frac=2.0,
  mult=2) put the 5 parts at 2/6/14/30/62·ATR → parts 3-5 essentially never fired (only ~1-2 of 5
  worked). Fixed the calibration to the doctrine ("ATR sets only the FIRST step", small): default
  grid_atr_frac 2.0→0.5, so parts sit at 0.5/1.5/3.5/7.5/15.5·ATR — part 1 the workhorse, outer ones
  the exponential emergency reserve (rarely hit, by design). Engine emits `grid_setup` trace events;
  Tab 9 now DRAWS the N working-part levels (dotted, labelled ч.1..N) + center, so the split is
  visible and you can see which parts are reachable. 71 tests. assets ?v=50.

## Tab 8/9 — уверенный флет: LITERAL lot scaling (заслуженный риск) (2026-06-04)
- **D48** — User: "we agreed ALL rules" — confident-flat was still ⚠ (detect only). Implemented the
  literal rule: after ≥confident_flat_n clean cycles, the working-part lot SCALES UP, funded by
  ACCRUED PROFIT only (heal_budget): scale = 1 + min(accrued/premium, 1) ∈ [1,2]. Capped ×2 so total
  scalp (n_parts·2·base) ≤ calls−base ⇒ still never naked. Engine `confident_flat_scale`(on) +
  `scalp_scaled_max`. Verified OU flat: scaling ON scalp +12.7k vs OFF +5.2k (same RTs, bigger lots),
  max ×2.00. Visible in the Tab 9 ledger (lot column grows) + panel rule ⚠→✅. 72 tests. assets ?v=52.
  - Panel now: only conditional ROLLING + daily-scalp-data-limit remain ⚠ (rolling = a real mechanic
    to add; data-limit is inherent, not fixable in code).

## Tab 8 parity — doctrine rule-panel + counters on the MAIN tab (2026-06-04)
- **D50** — User: "apply this on the main tab too — you should do it automatically." The rule LOGIC
  already ran identically on Tab 8 (one _run_hi→engine), but the rule-compliance PANEL + counters
  were Tab-9-only. Surfaced scalp_heals / confident_flat_days / scalp_scaled_max / n_parts /
  use_bbands in the `/api/hedged-intraday` stats; refactored `renderHiRules(d,s,id)` to take a target
  container + tolerate Tab-8 aggregate-only stats (scalp_opens/trend_days fall back); rendered the
  same panel under Tab 8. Verified Tab 8 SPY 2015: heals 6, confident-flat 2627 d, lot-scale max
  ×1.61, RT 252 — same engine. Per-trade ledger stays on Tab 9 (windowed; full-history ledger would
  be unusably large). 72 tests. assets ?v=54.
  - HABIT: when adding a doctrine feature, surface it on BOTH the main tab and the inspect tab —
    don't leave parity to a follow-up request.

## Tab 8/9 — INTRADAY scalp feed (hourly) — the long-open data item (2026-06-04)
- **D51** — User: "add an intraday feed for the scalp." `data.fetch_intraday(ticker, "60m", …)`
  (yfinance hourly ~730d history, cached, tz-naive). Engine `run_hedged_intraday(…, intraday=df)`:
  groups intraday bars by day and the scalp grid walks the REAL intraday path (many round-trips)
  instead of one daily OHLC bar; straddle/theta/rolls stay daily. `scalp_data` ('daily'|'hourly') on
  HedgedIntradayReq (Tab 8 + Tab 9; NOT the scan — 80×2y hourly would hammer yfinance). Graceful
  fallback to daily if the fetch fails. `res.intraday_bars` surfaced; rule-panel «Скальп» flips ⚠→✅
  when an intraday feed is used. Synthetic proof: intraday 62 RT/+2916 vs daily 16 RT/+398.
  - Honest scope: hourly ≈2y only, and 60m is still coarser than live 1-min ПИ — so it's a big step
    closer (sees intraday chop) but not full tick fidelity; recent-window only. 72 tests. assets ?v=56.

- **D52** — User: "start with what is available free" (re: getting true low-timeframe data to MEASURE
  the scalp — see the new `/tradinglivedata` skill's verdict: crypto 1-min/tick is FREE & deep via
  Binance, and ETH/BTC is the doctrine's IDEAL instrument). Added `data.fetch_intraday_crypto(ticker,
  interval='1m', …)` — paginates Binance public `/api/v3/klines` (1000 bars/req) over [start,end] via
  **stdlib urllib only** (no ccxt/requests dep), hosts `data-api.binance.vision` → `api.binance.com`
  (both reachable from the container, unlike Yahoo). tz-naive UTC index, cached per (symbol,interval);
  `_to_binance_symbol` maps BTC-USD/ETH-USD/SOL-USD→…USDT and returns None for non-crypto (graceful
  fallback). New `scalp_data='1m'` on HedgedIntradayReq → `_intraday_feed` routes crypto to the 1m feed
  (non-crypto/geo-block → daily). Tab 8 + Tab 9 selects gained the "1m crypto (Binance free)" option.
  Also gave `fetch()` a **Binance daily fallback** for crypto so the whole crypto path is Yahoo-free.
  Verified LIVE: ETH full free path (daily+1m both Binance) walked 23,040 real 1m bars; scalp measured
  (−363 over a trending 20-day window = honest: scalp loses in trend while straddle gamma wins, INV#3).
  4 new tests (symbol map, klines parse, non-crypto reject, @network live smoke). **76 tests green.**
  - Honest scope: free crypto only; SPY/GLD/SLV intraday → Polygon $29/mo, futures → Databento/IQ Feed,
    MOEX (RI/Si) → Finam/ISS (none of the free feeds cover it). 1m over multi-year = slow first pull
    (~1 req/1000 bars) then cached; pick a coarser interval for long windows. assets unchanged.

- **D53** — User: "integrate it in our 9/8 tabs." Made both ПИ tabs **feed-aware** (the dropdown +
  routing from D52 were in, but the UI hard-coded "часовых баров"/hourly). Backend: both
  `/api/hedged-intraday` + `/inspect` now surface `scalp_data` in stats. Frontend (app.js): the shared
  rule-panel «Скальп: внутридневной фид» line + the Tab-8 verdict now branch on `scalp_data` — show
  "1-МИНУТНЫЙ ФИД (Binance, крипта — БЕСПЛАТНО)" + bar count + "ближе всего к живому ПИ (200–250
  круг/мес)" when 1m; the daily-fallback hint now points crypto→«1m crypto», else→«hourly». Also made
  `fetch()`'s Binance **daily** fallback pull FULL history (start=None) so a short first request can't
  poison the daily cache (the 422 I hit). assets v56→v57. **76 tests green.** Verified LIVE through the
  route: ETH 120d scalp_data='1m' → HTTP 200, walked **64,800** real 1m bars, scalp +703 vs straddle
  −668 (net ~0) — first honest read where the scalp actually covered the theta on the doctrine's ideal
  instrument. (Scan tab still daily-only by design — 80×crypto-1m would be a huge pull.)

- **D54** — User: "in tab 9 nothing happens when push run button." Root cause: 1m + a multi-year window
  (they reused Tab 8's ~8-yr range) = thousands of sequential Binance requests → the request hung for
  many minutes (looked dead; could hit the gunicorn 900s timeout). Backend + assets were fine (deployed
  /inspect returns 200). Fix: **clamp the 1m feed to the last `ANTIMG_HI_1M_DAYS` days (default 120)** —
  mirrors the hourly 725d clamp; full-window straddle/theta, recent-window measured scalp. Verified: ETH
  2018→now + 1m on /inspect now 200 in 0.5s (was ~20 min unbounded). Also added an **immediate toast**
  on Tab 8/9 submit when an intraday feed is chosen ("Качаю 1-мин историю…") so it never looks hung, and
  imported `os` in api.py. assets v58. 76 tests.
  - First honest 1m ПИ reads (180d): ETH scalp +223/straddle −490 (cover 68%, CAGR −8.9%); BTC scalp
    −537/straddle −354 (cover −138%, −18.6%). Loss cap held (worst ≥ −premium). Confirms the skill: the
    scalp does NOT reliably pay theta even on crypto 1m — needs a ranging regime; gamma carries trends.

- **D55** — Perf: the 1m cold pull was still ~6 min even clamped to 60d (deployed: 352s). Root cause:
  `urllib.urlopen()` per page = fresh DNS+TLS handshake every request (~4s/req from the container).
  Fix: reuse ONE **keep-alive** `http.client.HTTPSConnection` across all pages (rotate hosts on error,
  fully read each response to reuse the socket). Result (deployed, fresh SOL ticker): **COLD 63s**
  (was 352s, 5.6×), **WARM 0.8s**. Default clamp 120→60d (v59). With the submit toast + spinner, the
  one-time ~60s cold pull is acceptable; cached after. assets v60. 76 tests. Live :8090 rebuilt.

- **D56** — User: "price drops 60k→17k and the straddle is NEGATIVE — nonsense!" + 3 more asks.
  - **STRADDLE SYMMETRY BUGFIX (the big one):** `base_futs` was `(2/3)·n_str` (hedge only ⅓ of the
    2·n_str calls = 33% floor = permanently **net-LONG** core, from the 2026-06-04 "trend reserve"
    change). That tilt bled the straddle on DOWN moves — BTC 61k→17k showed straddle −223. Corpus
    (20 cites) is unambiguous: the core is **delta-neutral & symmetric** ("30 Колл − 15 Фьюч" = sell
    calls/2), three-thirds is the SCALP limit (band centered on neutral), NOT a core tilt. Fix:
    `base_futs = 1.0·n_str`. Verified: BTC −72% straddle −223→**+1,270**; +496%→+30,553; GLD +47%→
    +3,009; loss cap intact. New regression test (crash AND rally must have gamma_dir>0). Superseded
    the wrong skill lesson. **77 tests.**
  - **More Binance assets:** Crypto catalog 3→30 coins (BTC/ETH/SOL/BNB/XRP/ADA/DOGE/AVAX/LINK/DOT/
    LTC/BCH/TRX/ATOM/… all map to Binance USDT for the free 1m feed) + a "Crypto (equity wrappers)"
    group (BITO/IBIT/MSTR/COIN). 111 catalog tickers.
  - **UI gate:** the `1m` scalp-data option is now **disabled for non-crypto tickers** (JS
    `isCryptoTicker` + per-form gate on ticker change; resets to daily) — was selectable for SPY etc.
    even though the feed is crypto-only.

    таймфрейме в реальном времени; дневные бары скрывают шум; флет = цену зажали в диапазоне на час/
    день; галоп = выход → отойти." So when an intraday feed is on, the BB flat/trend gate is now
    computed on the INTRADAY bars (rolling ~1-day band, win=max(bb_window, bars_per_day), k=bb_k) and
    each intraday bar is gated against its OWN band — not one daily verdict for the whole day. Price
    breaking the intraday range mid-day ⇒ step aside (galloping), inside ⇒ scalp. Falls back to the
    daily band when no intraday feed. Regime and feed are now consciously COUPLED (was independent by
    simplification).
  - **P&L from 0:** scalp + straddle already plotted from 0; the TOTAL was the bank curve (~$10k
    offset) on a "от 0" axis with fill-to-zero → dominated the chart. Now plot total as
    `equity_total − starting_bank` so all three start at 0 and total = straddle + scalp visually;

  perf limit), so any historical/multi-year window got NO 1m → silent daily fallback → ⚠. Real fix =
  **deep 1m via Binance BULK monthly dumps** (`data.binance.vision`, ~1 zip/month, ~2.4MB, handles the
  2025 ms→µs ts change): `_binance_1m_rows` uses monthly dumps for complete months + REST for the tail;
  `_binance_rest_rows`/`_binance_monthly_rows` factored out. Verified: BTC 2021-11→2022-05 1m = 260,640
  bars in 12s (was empty). **Three sub-bugs fixed:** (a) clamp made WINDOW-relative (`end−win`, not
  `today−win`) so old windows get 1m; default 60→**730d**; (b) cache was symbol+interval keyed →
  recent-data cache sliced to EMPTY for a historical window → made **coverage-aware + MERGE** (reuse
  only if it spans [start,end], else fetch & union); (c) **fixed UTF-8 double-encoding** in api.py that
  a prior `perl -0pi` (Cyrillic insert) caused — restored clean from e9b2579 + re-applied D58 via Edit.
  78 tests. Live :8090 rebuilt.

- **D60** — User: "видимо ты не везде починил" (⚠ still shows). Two real gaps, now addressed:
  (1) **default was `daily`** → every crypto run showed ⚠ until manually switched. Fix: `gateScalpData`
  now AUTO-selects `1m` when a crypto ticker is chosen (and reverts to daily for non-crypto) — so a
  crypto backtest measures the scalp by default. (2) **The message was misleading for non-crypto**: it
  told users to "switch to hourly", but hourly (yfinance) only covers the last ~2y, and there's NO free
  deep intraday for stocks/ETF/futures at all. Made the ⚠ rule-panel line + Tab-8 verdict
  INSTRUMENT-AWARE (uses `d.ticker` + `isCryptoTicker`): crypto → "pick 1m (free deep, any window)";
  non-crypto → honest — "no free deep intraday; hourly = recent ~2y only; deep history needs a paid
  vendor (Polygon ≈$29/mo, IQ Feed); free deep 1m exists ONLY for crypto." assets v64. 78 tests. Live rebuilt.

## D61 — "Эквивалент монетки": vol-invariant coverage + capture φ (2026-06-06)
- **Ask:** reduce ПИ to a coin-flip read ("is it 0.6 or 0.45?"), surface trades/month (check vs the
  corpus 200–250), and bridge the free 1m-crypto measurement to other assets via realized vol.
- **Decision:** the profitability test is `coverage = scalp_income / |theta|`. Sized to a fixed risk
  budget, both the per-trade scalp income AND the theta scale with σ·S, so **σ cancels → coverage is
  ~vol-invariant** (governed by trades/mo × capture fraction, not the instrument's vol). So measure
  the **capture fraction** (= harvested ÷ Σ daily range; doctrine ideal >0.5; NOT ÷ the 1m
  path-integral, which is feed-dependent) where we CAN (free 1m crypto) and project it onto any asset.
- **Built:** engine fields trades_per_month / profit_per_trade / capture_fraction / coverage_ratio /
  breakeven_capture (φ*) / period_win_rate (empirical p); `assumed_capture` knob (0.33) +
  `_coinflip_projection()` in /api/hedged-intraday, /inspect, /scan; Tab-8 "ЭКВИВАЛЕНТ МОНЕТКИ" panel.
- **Finding:** default grid step = daily ATR books only ~2 trades/mo on ETH 1m (too wide for minute
  noise). grid_atr_frac≈0.03 reproduces the doctrine 240/mo at 64% capture, but **coverage 0.76 < 1**
  on the (trending) ETH window ⇒ flat scalp doesn't fully pay theta; profit rides gamma →
  "0.45-to-0.5-type", regime-dependent. Over-tightening (gaf<0.02) collapses coverage.
- **Regression test:** coverage holds within 15% at 10× the $-vol (the invariance). 82 tests. v65.

## D62 — Vol-driven ANALYTIC scalp model: approximate any instrument from its volatility (2026-06-06)
- **Ask:** "mimic mathematically the approximate behaviour of all instruments based on their
  volatility at a given time" — i.e. estimate ПИ for instruments where free 1m data is absent.
- **Decision/model:** `scalp_model='analytic'` — scalp income/day ≈ **K · L_total · σ$(t)** (σ$ =
  daily realized $-vol, L_total = scalp lots sized to risk budget). Grounded in the Brownian
  crossing math (# h-round-trips/day ≈ (σ$/h)², gross ∝ σ$²/h, h ∝ σ$ ⇒ ∝ σ$·lots). Straddle
  theta+gamma stay EXACT (real path); only the unmeasurable scalp is vol-approximated. Needs NO
  intraday feed → runs for every instrument, time-varying with σ(t).
- **Calibration:** `calibrate_scalp_k()` bisects K so the analytic model reproduces the 1m-grid
  ground-truth scalp P&L (scalp compounds into straddle sizing → monotone, not exactly linear).
- **⚠ Honesty:** ONLY the magnitude scaling (∝ lots·σ$) is vol-invariant; K carries the intraday
  mean-reversion EDGE, which is NOT universal — 1m calib gave ETH +0.061 / SOL +0.0004 / BTC −0.0055
  (BTC trended, scalp lost). So the model is a SCENARIO at a chosen edge K (slider, default 0.02
  modest), result linear in K — not a prediction. High vol ≠ scalp wins (INVARIANT #3).
- **Built:** schema scalp_model+='analytic', scalp_k field (both req + scan); _run_hi passes scalp_k;
  Tab-8 model option + Scalp-K input + analytic verdict & coin-flip panel branches (coverage valid,
  trades/capture marked grid-only); scan uses analytic → every instrument gets a vol-driven estimate.
- **Cross-instrument (K=0.02, 2019–23):** coverage 0.24 (EURUSD quiet) → 0.72 (BTC); SLV/crypto top
  = the doctrine's volatile-oscillator sweet spot; none ≥1 at modest edge ⇒ profit rides gamma.
- 86 tests (+4). Skill: INVARIANT #7 caveat + lesson. assets v66.

## D63 — Closed-form P&L ATTRIBUTION model: what part builds which part of profit (2026-06-06)
- **Ask:** a mathematical model that approximately reproduces the backtest and concludes which part
  builds which part of the profit.
- **Model (`src/antimg/pi_model.py`), annual, sized to P=ρB:** Θ=−a (a=ρB/2T, vol-indep cost),
  Γ=+a·vr²·g (vr=σ_R/σ_I; CONVEX → trend builds it via straddle gamma), Σ=+C_s·ρB·vr
  (C_s=K·f·√252/0.4√T; LINEAR → scalp pays theta in the flat). Total=Γ+Σ+Θ; profitable ⟺
  vr²·g + 2T·C_s·vr > 1. g = gamma-capture (trend slice of realized variance), per-instrument.
- **Validation (engine GLD/SLV/SPY 2019–22):** theta & scalp within ~10–20% from first-principles
  constants (ATM call≈0.4σS√T); g fit from the run reproduces gamma exactly. SPY g≈0.68 (trends),
  SLV g≈0.28 (chops).
- **Built:** pi_model.py (closed_form/attribute_measured/calibrate_gamma_capture);
  /api/hedged-intraday/attribution (measured truth + closed-form reproduction + conclusion); Tab-8
  «🧮 Атрибуция прибыли» button + stacked-bar (theta/gamma-trend/scalp-flat) + verdict. assets v67.
- **Conclusion it outputs:** net = TREND(gamma ∝vr²) + FLAT(scalp ∝vr) − theta(const); attributes %
  of gross profit to each, names the regime (trend-built / flat-built / bleeding). 91 tests (+5).

## D64 — Data-driven g/K + attribution extrapolation across ALL instruments (2026-06-06)
- **Ask:** estimate g from data (autocorrelation) so the attribution is predictive without a backtest;
  extrapolate across all instruments using the crypto-anchored model.
- **Built (`pi_model.py`):** variance_ratio(close,k) (Lo–MacKinlay); gamma_capture_from_vr=VR/(VR+1)
  (data-driven trend fraction g, validated vs backtest gamma corr≈0.4); scalp_k_from_vr=base_k·(1−VR)
  clipped (mean-rev→K>0, trend→K<0). Endpoint /api/hedged-intraday/extrapolate: per instrument read
  σ_I (vol surface ATM), σ_R (realized), VR63 from DAILY data → closed-form attribution; no per-instrument
  backtest. Tab-8 «🌐 Экстраполяция на все инструменты» button + ranked table + aggregate.
- **Result (108 instr, base K=0.04, 2018+):** 107/108 bleed, median −8%/yr — because σ_I>σ_R (variance
  risk premium) + modest daily-VR scalp edge. Decomposition is the value: mean-reverting → scalp carries;
  trending → gamma carries, scalp bleeds (USO/AVAX/DOGE scalp<0, trend%100). theta=−a for all.
- **Honesty:** gamma/g leg well-grounded (daily backtest measures gamma faithfully); scalp/K MAGNITUDE
  rough (true intraday edge only on crypto 1m). Broad bleed = conservative edge + VRP, not "method fails."
- 94 tests (+3). Skill: lesson data-driven-g-from-variance-ratio. assets v68.

## D65 — Direct positive-only CAPTURE scalp from real daily ranges (2026-06-06)
- **Ask (user):** stop over-engineering — estimate the scalp simply: we have the real daily moves, we
  catch ~50% of each with ~200–250 trades/mo, and we close ONLY profits (losers carried, capped by the
  premium). Compute scalp & its share of profit directly.
- **Model:** `scalp_model='capture'`: scalp/day = scalp_capture × (daily High−Low) × part_lots, summed
  over real history, POSITIVE-ONLY (no loss term; carried legs hedged by the long calls & capped by the
  premium=theta). Linear in capture. capture_fraction output == input.
- **Built:** engine branch + `scalp_capture` (req+scan); _run_hi threads it; /api/hedged-intraday/
  extrapolate REWRITTEN to run the capture model across the whole catalog from real daily ranges
  (theta+gamma exact from the path) → per-instrument theta/gamma/scalp/coverage + ranked table; Tab-8
  «capture» model option + Capture input + capture verdict & coin-flip panel; extrapolation table shows
  coverage = scalp÷|theta|. assets v69.
- **vs grid:** capture > grid because the grid pessimistically realizes carried losers into the scalp;
  those belong to the straddle leg (which hedges them). No double-count (synthetic straddle self-hedges).
- 96 tests (+2). Skill: lesson scalp-is-positive-only-capture-of-the-real-daily-range.

## D66 — Realistic capture anchor (0.20) + per-CLASS capture presets for the extrapolation (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (continue, open idea (a)):** the catalog extrapolation rode an OPTIMISTIC flat `capture=0.5`;
  default it to the grid-calibrated REALISTIC level and let capture vary by asset class.
- **Why 0.5 was wrong:** the only place capture was measured against a real 1m feed is crypto (ETH grid
  ~64% raw but coverage 0.76<1 on a trending window; BTC trended → scalp LOST). After costs + regime,
  the realistic level is ≈0.20. Flat 0.5 also double-counts (same calls give gamma AND cover stuck scalp).
- **Built:**
  - `instruments.CAPTURE_DEFAULT=0.20` + `CAPTURE_PRESET` (per-class) + `capture_preset(group)`. Rangy,
    mean-reverting intraday classes ↑ (Metals 0.26, Energy 0.24, Agriculture/Crypto-1m 0.22, FX 0.18);
    trend-prone ↓ (equity indices/sectors 0.15, Mega-cap 0.14, Volatility 0.12). All in [0.12,0.26].
  - Schemas: `scalp_capture` default 0.5→**0.20** (both Req & ScanReq, incl. single-instrument Tab-8);
    ScanReq += `capture_mode` ("preset"|"flat", default preset).
  - `/api/hedged-intraday/extrapolate`: when preset, each instrument uses `capture_preset(its group)`
    (else the flat number); rows carry the used `capture`; aggregate carries `capture_mode`+`capture_range`.
  - Tab-8 UI: Capture default 0.20, new **Capture mode** selector, extrapolation verdict describes the
    per-class band + the realistic-anchor caveat, table shows a `capt` column.
- **Honesty (skill INVARIANT #7):** presets are a SCENARIO at a chosen edge, NOT a forecast — the intraday
  mean-reversion edge is regime-specific and varies WITHIN a class (ETH ranged, BTC trended). Result stays
  linear in capture, so the flat knob still works for sensitivity.
- 97 tests (+1: per-class preset ordering + anchor + band). assets v72.

## D67 — Tab 10: Pure straddle backtest (hold to expiry, no scalp) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** a new tab for a PURE straddle (no intraday) — spend a configurable % of the deposit
  (default 1%) on a straddle, hold to expiration, see the result. "We have all data, no extra API,
  options priced backwards, right?"
- **Data answer (honest):** no extra API needed, BUT we do NOT pull real historical option quotes (that
  needs a paid chain feed). The entry premium is a **Black-Scholes model price** from the vol surface
  (realized vol / CBOE VIX term structure) on the REAL underlying price; the expiry payoff |S_T−K| uses
  the real price path. Accuracy rides on the IV model; since IV usually ≥ realized (variance-risk
  premium), buy-and-hold straddles are typically −EV — which is exactly what the tab shows.
- **Built:**
  - `options.put_price` + `options.straddle_price` (ATM call+put, the "rent" to be long vol).
  - `src/antimg/pure_straddle.py::run_pure_straddle`: roll ATM straddles to expiry, size each to
    `risk_pct` of the (optionally compounding) bank; per-period record entry/expiry/IV/premium/units/
    payoff/pnl/bank + move% vs breakeven%; summary = win rate, net, CAGR, profit factor, total premium
    vs payoff, **premium_recovered_pct**, **avg_breakeven_pct vs avg_move_pct** (the VRP gap). Loss is
    floored at the premium (a long option can't lose more than it cost).
  - `PureStraddleReq` + `POST /api/pure-straddle`; Tab 10 UI (equity curve, win/loss P&L histogram,
    honest verdict incl. the BS-model-not-a-quote caveat, per-period table). assets v73.
- **Live finding (sanity):** SPY 30d ATM straddles 2012–23 (real VIX surface) = 28% win, **−3%/yr**,
  premium only 74% recovered, breakeven 4.24% vs 3.14% realized move = the VRP eating it. GLD similar
  (−1.8%/yr, 85% recovered). Confirms long straddles bleed held to expiry — the rent the ПИ scalp must pay.
- 105 tests (+8: put-call parity, straddle=call+put, flat-loses-premium, big-move-wins, P&L identity,
  risk_pct linearity, breakeven, endpoint).

## D68 — Tab 10 fix: Risk % field is a true PERCENT (1 = 1%) + show call/put leg split (2026-06-07)
- **Bug (user caught):** Tab-10 "Risk % депозита" defaulted to a FRACTION (0.01) but was labeled "%", so
  entering `1` (meaning 1%) was read as `risk_pct=1.0` = **100% of the deposit per straddle** → the bank
  was wiped to ~0 by the third year and every later row showed zeros. The table proved it: "заплачено $"
  = the full bank each period, not 1%.
- **Fix:**
  - Frontend field is now a true PERCENT: label "Risk % депозита (1 = 1%)", default value `1`; the submit
    handler divides by 100 before POST (API still takes a 0–1 fraction, unchanged & consistent with Tab 8).
  - Engine prices the two legs separately (`options.call_price` + `put_price`) and records `call_cost` /
    `put_cost` per period; Tab-10 table shows «колл $» / «пут $» columns and the verdict notes the risk %
    covers BOTH legs together (≈ equal for ATM, call a touch richer via carry).
- **Verified:** SPY 1% real run → row1 pays exactly 100.00 (1% of 10k) = call 54.03 + put 45.97; bank now
  bleeds slowly (−2.7%/yr over 2010–26, 77% premium recovered) instead of being wiped by 100% bets.
- 106 tests (+1: call_cost+put_cost==premium & first period == 1% of bank). assets v74.

## D69 — Tab 10: outcome distribution + win/loss streak distribution (coin-flip style) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** add a distribution like the coin-flip tab — how many periods in profit vs loss — AND
  the streaks of consecutive wins/losses ("3/4/5 in a row").
- **Built:**
  - Engine: `_streak_counts(outcomes)` → `{run_length: count}` for win-runs and loss-runs; result now
    carries `n_losses`, `max_win_streak`, `max_loss_streak`, `avg_win`, `avg_loss`, `win_streaks`,
    `loss_streaks`. Endpoint returns the streak dicts + the new summary fields.
  - Tab-10 UI: two new charts — **«Исходы: в плюсе vs в минусе»** (green/red count bars with %) and
    **«Серии подряд»** (grouped bars: # of win-runs vs loss-runs at each length 1..max). Verdict adds a
    streak tally line ("победы подряд: 1×28, 2×8, 3×2, 4×2 / убытки подряд: …") + avg win/avg loss.
- **Finding (the value):** SPY 30d straddles 2010–26 → 58W/137L (29.7%), **max 20-loss streak** (the
  calm 2013–17 low-vol grind), loss-runs cluster (six 6-in-a-rows); wins are mostly isolated (1×28). The
  long-straddle signature: frequent clustered losses, rare isolated wins — exactly why it bleeds.
- 108 tests (+2: `_streak_counts` cases; engine streak/count self-consistency Σ run_len×count == totals).
  assets v75.

## D70 — Tab 10: win/loss random-walk chart (+1 win / −1 loss, cumulative) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** add a graph where loss = −1, win = +1, plotted cumulatively over all periods.
- **Built (frontend-only, derived from the per-period `win` flags already in the payload):** new
  **«Серии: +1 победа / −1 убыток, накопит.»** chart on Tab 10 — cumulative ±1 over the expiry-date axis,
  zero line, line/fill green if it ends ≥0 else red, title shows the ending level (= #wins − #losses).
  Down-slopes = losing streaks, up-slopes = winning streaks (the streak-shape view over time).
- No backend/test change (pure visualization of tested data). assets v76.

## D71 — Tab 11: Call vs Put — each leg analysed separately (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** a tab that analyses call and put SEPARATELY — how many calls landed in profit, their
  streaks, and the same for puts.
- **Built:**
  - Engine `run_single_leg(daily, vol, leg='call'|'put', …)` — same roll-to-expiry mechanics as the
    straddle but ONE leg: premium = BS call/put price, payoff = max(S_T−K,0) call / max(K−S_T,0) put,
    sized to risk_pct of its OWN bank. Refactored the shared summary/streak/CAGR bookkeeping into
    `_finalize(res, compounding)` (reused by both engines). `move_pct` is now SIGNED for a leg.
  - Endpoint `POST /api/leg-analysis` (reuses PureStraddleReq) runs BOTH legs, returns `{call, put,
    ticker, vol_model}`. Refactored straddle endpoint to share `_ps_summary`/`_ps_payload`/`_ps_load_daily`.
  - Tab-11 UI: per-leg **win/loss random-walk** + **streak distribution** charts (call & put), a grouped
    **outcome-count** chart, and a verdict block per leg (win rate, max streaks, CAGR, premium recovered,
    streak tallies). Notes the legs are near-mirror (call wins up-moves, put down-moves).
- **Finding:** SPY 2010–26 (bull) → CALL 43% win, max 10-loss streak, −1.2%/yr, 90% premium recovered;
  PUT only 20.5% win, **max 17-loss streak**, −4.5%/yr, 62% recovered. Directional asymmetry is stark —
  puts almost never paid in a rising market. Both legs −EV (IV premium); call+put together = Tab 10.
- 111 tests (+3: call-wins-up / put-wins-down, leg streak+1%-sizing+cost-column, leg endpoint). assets v77.

## D72 — Coin-flip ±R trial resolution for Tabs 10 & 11 (fixed risk/reward, roll to ±R) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** reframe win/loss as a COIN FLIP with fixed risk/reward translated to option reality —
  a "trial" rolls the straddle/leg across expiries until cumulative P&L reaches +R (win) or −R (loss),
  R = risk_pct × bank. A partial loss is carried (next roll risks only the remaining capacity, total loss
  capped at −R); a partial gain is carried (wait for the rest of +R). Apply to Tab 10 and Tab 11.
- **Decision (user-confirmed):** book ACTUAL P&L — loss = exactly −R, win = the actual cum at crossing
  (≥ +R, can overshoot on a big move = long-option convexity). Capped loss + convex win.
- **Built:**
  - Engine `run_coinflip_trials(daily, vol, leg='straddle'|'call'|'put', …)` → `TrialResult` (n_trials,
    win/loss, streaks, avg win/loss, avg/max rolls, equity, trials table). Each roll's premium =
    R + cum (remaining capacity to the −R floor); a worthless roll lands cum exactly at −R.
  - Schema `PureStraddleReq.resolution` ('expiry' | 'coinflip'). Endpoints branch: `/api/pure-straddle`
    and `/api/leg-analysis` run the trial engine when resolution='coinflip'; shared `_trial_summary`/
    `_trial_payload` mirror the per-expiry payload keys so the UI charts are reused.
  - UI: a **Resolution** toggle on both tabs (UI default coin-flip). renderStraddle/renderLegs branch on
    `d.mode`; shared `outcomeWalk`/`outcomeStreaks`/`outcomeHist` helpers drive both modes; coin-flip
    verdicts explain the ±R mechanic + avg/max rolls; trial table (start/end, rolls, R, premia Σ, P&L).
- **Finding (SPY 2010–26, R=1%):** straddle coin-flip resolves SLOWLY (~34 rolls/trial → only ~5 trials,
  20% win, avg win 181 vs loss −99 capped). Legs resolve fast (call ~2 rolls/33% win; put ~1.3 rolls/12%
  win, 23-loss streak). Loss capped at −R, wins overshoot = the convexity.
- 115 tests (+4: loss-capped-at-−R, win-overshoot+streak-consistency, partial-loss-carried, coin-flip
  endpoints for straddle & legs). assets v78.

## D73 — Coin-flip trials: max-roll HORIZON (fix multi-year / swallowed-timeline trials) (2026-06-07)
- **Symptom (user):** the straddle coin-flip table stopped at 2011 (only 3 trials). **Cause:** with the
  remaining-capacity sizing (D72, the user's −80 rule), a 30-day SPY straddle rarely doubles or zeroes in
  one expiry, so a *losing* trial grinds toward −R over dozens of ever-smaller rolls — and one trial that
  started 2011 never resolved, rolling until the data ran out in 2026, then got discarded as incomplete →
  the timeline 2011–2026 was silently swallowed.
- **Fix (user-chosen): keep the −80 rule + add a max-roll HORIZON.** `run_coinflip_trials(max_rolls=12)`:
  if a trial hasn't hit ±R within max_rolls rolls, close it at its ACTUAL cum (partial win if cum≥0 else
  partial loss, `Trial.partial=True`) and start a fresh trial. So loss ≈ −R, but time is bounded.
- **Built:** engine `max_rolls` param + `partial` flag + `n_partial` count; `PureStraddleReq.max_rolls`
  (default 12, ge1 le120); both endpoints pass it (NOT run_single_leg); summary carries `n_partial`; UI
  «Max rolls (горизонт)» input on tabs 10 & 11, verdict shows partial count + horizon, trial table «как
  закрыт» column (±R vs горизонт).
- **Result (SPY 2010–26, R=1%, horizon 12):** straddle now 18 trials spanning to 2026-04 (was stuck at
  2011), 16/18 closed by horizon (partial), 11% win, CAGR −0.8%. Timeline no longer swallowed.
- 116 tests (+1 horizon-closes-partial-and-continues; updated loss-cap & overshoot tests for partials).
  assets v79.

## D74 — Coin-flip trials: book the data-truncated TAIL (fix "stops at 2025") (2026-06-07)
- **Symptom (user, DTE≈90):** straddle coin-flip table stopped at 2025-03-17 though data runs to 2026.
  **Cause:** with DTE 90 × horizon 12 a trial can need ~3 years; the final trial started 2025 and ran
  past end-of-data before hitting ±R or the horizon, so it was DISCARDED as incomplete → the tail dropped.
- **Fix:** when data runs out mid-trial, BOOK the tail as a partial (close at actual cum, `partial=True`,
  win if cum≥0) instead of discarding — so the timeline always reaches the last available expiry. Only
  drop a tail that couldn't complete even one roll (n_rolls==0).
- **UI:** trial table «как закрыт» now distinguishes ±R / горизонт (partial & n_rolls≥max_rolls) / данные
  (partial & n_rolls<max_rolls = data-truncated tail).
- **Result:** SPY DTE90 coin-flip now reaches 2026-03-16 (was 2025). Tail no longer dropped.
- Also confirmed the coin-flip risk approach is fully on Tab 11 (per-leg, with horizon) — user request.
- 117 tests (+1 truncated-tail-is-booked-not-dropped). assets v80.

## D75 — Coin-flip: TAKE-PROFIT at +R + "coin-flip language" (p, payoff b, breakeven p*) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** "you're not fixing profit — when up +R, take it and roll a fresh straddle" + "how to
  translate to coin-flip language, like 0.6?".
- **Take-profit (D75a):** `run_coinflip_trials(take_profit=True, default)` — when cum reaches +R, book
  EXACTLY +R (close at the +R level, assume we exited when it crossed) and roll fresh → a clean symmetric
  ±R coin (every full win = +R, full loss = −R). `take_profit=False` = let winners run (book actual cum
  ≥ +R = convex overshoot). Schema `take_profit` (default True) + UI toggle on tabs 10 & 11 + verdict note.
- **Coin-flip language (D75b):** `_trial_summary` now emits `coin_p` (= win rate), `payoff_ratio`
  b = avg_win/|avg_loss|, `breakeven_p` p*=1/(1+b), `edge_p` = p−p*, `coin_p_symmetric` (the fair 1:1
  coin with the same EV per R). Shown in both verdicts (tabs 10 & 11).
- **The insight (SPY, R=1%):** with take-profit ON it's a CLEAN ±R coin and p is THE number — SPY straddle
  is only a **p≈0.11–0.29 coin (1:1, breakeven 0.5) ⇒ −EV**. With take-profit OFF, p is the same but wins
  overshoot (b≈2.4) → breakeven drops to ≈p → roughly break-even. So the straddle is a LOSING coin that
  survives only by letting the rare big wins run (the convexity). Honest "0.6?" answer: no — ~0.1–0.3.
- 119 tests (+2: take-profit-clean-±R, coin-language-fields; fixed overshoot test to take_profit=False +
  volatile GBM path so wins occur). assets v82.

## D76 — Per-trial picture (roll-by-roll), disable irrelevant IV inputs, fee clarity (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** (a) per-line picture of each coin-flip trial (why premium is sometimes >R, sometimes
  <R over 12 rolls); (b) disable IV window/const when IV source=auto; (c) clarify Skew β / Term structure
  / Risk-free r / commission & slippage per-side vs round-trip.
- **Per-trial picture:** engine `Trial.rolls` = per-roll ledger (entry/expiry/spot_in/out/iv/premium/
  payoff/pnl/cum). Tab-10 trial table rows are now CLICKABLE → `renderTrialDetail`: a dual-axis chart
  (per-roll premium bars + cumulative-P&L line walking to the ±R rails) + a price chart + per-roll ledger
  (premium colored green/red vs R). Shows directly that each roll's premium = R + cum (below R after a
  partial loss, above R after a partial gain). First trial auto-shown.
- **IV input gating:** `gateIvInputs()` greys+disables IV window unless iv_source=realized, and IV const
  unless iv_source=constant (disabled inputs aren't submitted → backend default). Wired on tabs 3? no —
  tabs 10, 11, 8, 9 (the ones with these inputs). [Skew β ~no-op for ATM; term structure on; r minor.]
- **Fee semantics (clarified, already correct):** commission_pct & slippage_pct are PER SIDE — charged on
  the entry premium AND the exit payoff (twice per straddle), not once.
- 119 tests (engine field add covered by existing trial tests). assets v83.

## D77 — Tab 12: ПИ × Antimartingale overlay (pyramid-on-wins on ПИ period results) + shuffle test (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** new tab — take the Hedged Intraday (ПИ) results per monthly/quarterly period (win/loss)
  and apply the antimartingale (double risk after a win, reset after a loss, stop at target streak) to
  see if pyramiding on win-streaks adds alpha.
- **Built:**
  - `am_overlay.apply_overlay(pnls, target_streak, n_shuffles)` — pyramid-on-wins over a period-P&L
    sequence (give-back form: loss at high mult costs mult×|loss|, no intra-period stop, matching "double
    the RISK"). Returns flat vs overlay equity, per-period ledger (mult/contribution/cum), max DD/streak/
    mult, AND the **shuffle test** (skill doctrine: pyramid makes no edge on a fair coin; only genuine
    win-CLUSTERING beats a shuffled order — `real_pctile` = where the real result sits in the shuffle dist).
  - `AntimgOverlayReq(HedgedIntradayReq)` + `am_period` (monthly→DTE30 / quarterly→DTE90 / asis) +
    `target_streak` + `n_shuffles`; `POST /api/hedged-intraday/antimartingale` runs ПИ → overlay.
  - Tab-12 UI: equity (flat vs AM), shuffle histogram with real+flat markers, per-period table,
    doctrine-grounded verdict (clustering vs leverage).
- **Finding (honest, as doctrine predicts):** SPY monthly ПИ (capture 0.2) is a p=0.28 LOSING series;
  flat −9.9k, antimartingale −24.8k (alpha −14.9k), real at 16th pctile of shuffles ⇒ wins DISPERSED,
  pyramiding amplifies a losing non-clustered distribution. GLD quarterly same (real 4th pctile). The
  overlay adds NO alpha — it's leverage on whatever drift/clustering exists, and ПИ has neither here.
- 125 tests (+6: pyramid mechanics, give-back, shuffle detects clustering / neutral on IID, order-indep
  flat, endpoint). assets v84. SKILL sanity-check #3 honored (shuffle, not detrend).

## D78 — Tab 12: DOCTRINE 9/3 source (test antimartingale at ПИ's real win-rate) + EV-identity line (2026-06-07)
- **User challenge (correct):** the backtest gave p=0.28 (losing) only because free daily data can't see
  the intraday scalp; per ПИ doctrine it's ~9 positive / 3 negative months (p≈0.75) — which is PERFECT for
  antimartingale ((2p)^N−1 > 0 at p>0.5). **Consulted the ПИ guru** (`hedgedintraday/consult.sh`) — CONFIRMED:
  Korovin plans ~75% win-rate, 5–7%/mo target → 25–40%/yr; negatives are "tухлые" months where scalp doesn't
  cover theta. The daily backtest under-measures the scalp → understates win-rate.
- **Built:** `AntimgOverlayReq.source` = 'backtest' | **'doctrine'** (default doctrine) + d_win_rate(0.75)/
  d_win_pct(6)/d_loss_pct(5)/d_n_periods(120)/d_seed. Doctrine = synthetic i.i.d. 9/3 sequence at the
  planned win-rate (no network). Endpoint branches; UI source toggle + doctrine inputs; verdict now shows
  the **EV identity** `b·[(2p)^N−1]` and separates two questions: (1) AM-beats-flat = the p>0.5 effect, (2)
  shuffle = does clustering add extra.
- **Result (doctrine p=0.75):** AM alpha GROWS with target streak exactly per the identity — N=2 +25k, N=3
  +74k, N=4 +108k, N=5 +264k (flat 71.4k); shuffle neutral (i.i.d. → gain is from p>0.5, not clustering).
  At p=0.5 fair coin: AM≈flat≈0 (no manufactured edge — sanity-check #3 holds). The user was right: at the
  doctrine win-rate the antimartingale is the whole point and adds large alpha.
- 127 tests (+2: doctrine high-winrate beats flat, fair-coin no edge). assets v85. numpy imported at api top.

## D79 — THEORY: coin-flip decomposition of ПИ's win-rate (skill model, no app code yet) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** go back-and-forth with the ПИ guru, build the coin-flip analogy rigorously (e.g.
  "0.45 from straddle + 0.15 from intraday = 0.60, minus costs ≈ 0.55") and update the skills; then build on it.
- **Did 3 guru consults** (corpus 5fada65b) + used our Tab-10 straddle data. Built the model:
  - A month wins ⟺ `Γ + Σ > 1` (gamma capture + scalp, in units of monthly theta). **Threshold-shift
    decomposition (EXACT):** `p_net = p_straddle + Δp_scalp + Δp_margin − Δp_cost`.
  - Grounded: p_straddle ≈ 0.28–0.45 (Tab-10; VRP makes it <0.5); scalp coverage c ≈ 0.30–0.45 of monthly
    theta ⇒ Δp_scalp ≈ +0.15; **free-margin income** f (80–90% of deposit at risk-free rate subsidizes the
    rent) ⇒ Δp_margin ≈ +0.10–0.15 (the guru's critical addition); Δp_cost ≈ −0.05.
  - **Central p_net ≈ 0.60** (skeleton straddle+scalp 0.55 → +free-margin → 0.60; Korovin optimistic 0.75).
  - EV form (same statement): profitable ⟺ `c + f > (1 − rv/iv) + costs/θ` — coverage+margin must beat the
    variance-risk-premium gap (strongest where rv>iv, e.g. CNY). Payoff asymmetric (win 2–3R, loss ≤ −1R).
  - **Bridge:** p_net>0.5 ⇒ antimartingale `E[cycle]=b·[(2p)^N−1]>0`, grows with N → ПИ makes a >0.5 coin,
    the pyramid compounds it. Swing factor = execution (mechanical "ноль минус комиссии" → c→0 → edge dies).
- **Skills updated** (canonical home, not repo): `hedgedintraday/references/coin-flip-decomposition.md`
  (full model, 9 sections) + SKILL.md INVARIANT #8 + lessons.md; `antimartingal-strategy` SKILL.md gets the
  ПИ bridge under the EV identity. NEXT (build on it): a Tab-12 calculator panel that takes
  p_straddle/c/f/cost → p_net → feeds the antimartingale EV (one screen).
- No app/test change this turn (theory + skill only). Tests still 127.

## D80 — CORRECTION to D79: the math breaks Korovin's 0.75 — own coin ≈ 0.51–0.55 (2026-06-07)
- **User challenge (correct):** if the scalp covers only 10–15% of premium/month (= 30–45% of theta),
  you mathematically CANNOT claim a 0.75 win-rate. Challenge it.
- **Worked it out:** a delta-hedged straddle's monthly P&L = RV²−IV² (gamma), so a month wins iff
  `RV > IV·√(1 − c − f)` (c = scalp coverage of θ ≈ 0.35, f = free-margin carry coverage). With
  IV=(1+vrp)·mean(RV), vrp≈0.10, RV lognormal CV≈0.5:
  - **scalp ONLY (c=0.35): win-rate ≈ 0.51 — a FAIR COIN.** Cannot reach 0.75 from the scalp.
  - 0.73–0.75 needs coverage ~0.63 → the extra ~0.28 is the **free-margin CARRY at 20% RUB rates** (idle
    cash in T-bills), NOT the straddle+scalp edge. At USD ~4% rates carry ≈ 0.06 → win-rate ≈ 0.55.
- **Critical for the antimartingale:** the carry is a CONSTANT additive drip that does NOT pyramid with
  wins/losses ⇒ it must NOT be in the AM coin `p`. The AM coin = the strategy's OWN win-rate **≈ 0.51–0.55**
  ⇒ `(2p)^N−1 ≈ 0` ⇒ **the antimartingale adds ~nothing to ПИ.** ПИ's real edge is the ASYMMETRIC payoff
  (loss ≤ −1R, win 2–3R convex) → +EV at a ~fair coin, precisely the regime where AM gives no edge.
- **Supersedes D79's 0.55→0.60→0.75 (carry-inflated + optimistic). Honest own-coin ≈ 0.51–0.55.**
- Skills updated: coin-flip-decomposition.md gets a binding **§0 REALITY CHECK** (the RV>IV·√(1−c−f)
  identity + win-rate table); hedgedintraday SKILL INVARIANT #8 + antimartingal SKILL bridge both revised
  to "strip carry, sanity-check p against the gamma identity, AM adds ~nothing at p≈0.5". No app/test change.

## D81 — Guru-validated the carry-stripped correction (discuss-before-edit) + instrument refinement (2026-06-07)
- **User process correction:** discuss the correction WITH the guru BEFORE editing the skill; explicitly
  tell it the model leans on RUB 20% carry and must be market-agnostic (US/EU/crypto, not just RF).
- **4th consult (market-agnostic challenge).** Corpus CONFIRMS: (1) without free-margin carry, straddle+
  scalp win-rate "на спокойном рынке стремится к 0.5" (D80's ~0.51 holds); (2) the ASYMMETRY (convex
  2–3R win, capped loss) is the cornerstone, win-rate is a derivative; (3) the 75% IS RUB-rate-dependent.
- **Refinement (new):** on low-carry markets the lever that keeps p>0.5 is the INSTRUMENT, not carry —
  high-vol *wicky / mean-reverting* underlyings (ETH, metals) give the scalp more round-trips ⇒ higher
  coverage c ⇒ higher p. But `p = P(RV > IV·√(1−c))` is VOL-SCALE-INVARIANT, so it's `c` (intraday
  mean-reversion), not the vol level, that lifts p (ties to INVARIANT #7: ETH ranged c↑ / BTC trended
  c≈0→p<0.5). Modest targets / earlier rolling raise win-rate but shrink per-win b (win-rate↔payoff trade).
- **Market-agnostic honest coin: ~0.5 on calm assets, ~0.55–0.60 on wicky mean-reverting assets (ETH),
  carry on top (RUB only); the durable universal edge is the asymmetry.** Skill §0 + lessons updated with
  the validated refinement. PROCESS LESSON: consult the guru to validate a correction BEFORE locking the
  skill — here the dialogue confirmed D80 AND added the instrument lever. No app/test change (127 tests).

## D82 — Tab 13: ПИ Coin estimator (ex-ante p_net) + RV/IV is the master filter (SPY puzzle resolved) (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** stop theorizing — build a MODEL that says, in advance, whether an instrument is a
  ≥~0.6 coin (net of commission/slippage) so we know if the antimartingale is justified. Then user
  challenged: SPY is volatile, strange it scores poorly — challenge the guru.
- **Built `pi_coin.py` + Tab 13.** Model: a period wins ⟺ `RV > IV·√(1−c_net)` (gamma capture (RV/IV)²
  + scalp coverage c net of costs). **p_net = fraction of historical periods** beating the breakeven,
  from the instrument's own RV distribution + IV — no lognormal assumption. Reports: p_net at chosen c,
  the **p_net(c) curve + critical c\*** (coverage needed for 0.55/0.60), diagnostics (RV/IV, wickiness,
  VR(63)), a proxy `c_suggest`, walk-forward `p_in/p_out` (1st vs 2nd half), payoff b / EV; `scan` ranks
  the whole catalog. Endpoint `POST /api/pi-coin` (single + scan). 132 tests (+5). assets v86.
- **SPY puzzle RESOLVED (guru-validated, 4th consult):** SPY p_net≈0.32 NOT because it lacks vol — because
  its options are structurally RICH (RV/IV≈0.73; VIX>realized = the equity variance-risk premium / insurance
  bid) → long-straddle ПИ bleeds. **High ABSOLUTE vol ≠ good; cheap vol (RV≥IV) is the master filter.**
  Korovin AGREES: "universal" = the MECHANICS, not the edge — select inefficient cheap-vol names
  (CNY/crypto/silver), avoid rich-vol indices. ETH p_net≈0.69–0.75 (RV/IV≈1.0, c* for 0.6≈0.12–0.23,
  stable p_in/out) — antimartingale-worthy; SPY needs c*≈0.63 (unrealistic) despite strong intraday MR
  (VR 0.59). Skill: coin-flip-decomposition.md §10 (ex-ante selection) + lessons.
- **Verdict logic:** p_net≥0.55 ⇒ antimartingale makes sense; else the edge is the convex payoff, not streaks.

## D83 — Tab 13: one-click "Rate ALL instruments" button + wickiness cap (2026-06-07)
- One-click `🏆 Оценить ВСЕ инструменты` button forces scan=true → ranks the whole catalog by p_net
  (was only via the dropdown). Live rating (2019–26, c=0.35): **109 rated, 86≥0.60, median 0.67**; TOP =
  metals/energy/agri/crypto/FX (RV/IV≈1.0, VR<1); BOTTOM = equity INDICES SPY/DIA/^DJI (RV/IV 0.73, the
  rich-vol VRP) — confirms the SPY finding generalizes. ETH flagged unstable (p_out 0.50) vs stable metals.
- Capped `wickiness` at 12 (FX daily Open≈Close → tiny denominator blew the ratio to 40–96; data artifact,
  does not affect p_net). assets v88. 132 tests.

## D84 — Tab 13 HONESTY FIX: flag real-IV vs proxied + VRP haircut + cap blowups (2026-06-07)
- **User caught it:** the rating can't "safely say X is better than SPY" — only 7 classes have a REAL
  vol index (sp500→VIX, nasdaq→VXN, dow→VXD, russell→RVX, gold→GVZ, oil→OVX, eurusd→EVZ); everything else
  proxies IV=realized → RV/IV≈1 BY CONSTRUCTION → falsely flatters them. **Guru-confirmed (5th consult):**
  IV usually > RV (VRP); crypto IV is 60-90% (NOT cheap — ETH wins on the SCALP, not cheap vol); silver
  IV ~90%; only manually-managed FX (CNY/Si) are genuinely cheap-IV. Assuming IV=RV is "критически опасно".
- **Fix:** (a) `CoinEstimate.iv_is_real` (label starts 'index:') surfaced per row + single verdict;
  (b) `vrp_proxy` (default 0.15) haircut — for proxied instruments inflate IV by (1+vrp) (g /= (1+vrp)²)
  so they're compared fairly to real-IV names; (c) cap g at 16 + clamp EV/payoff in scan (kills the
  ARB-USD 9e10 short-history blowups). Scan shows «IV=реал/≈прокси», p_net* asterisk for proxied, and a
  big "trust only IV=реал (N of M)" caveat; aggregate adds n_real_iv.
- **Effect:** ETH 0.75→**0.54** (proxied, 15% haircut, flagged estimate) vs SPY **0.32** (real VIX). ETH
  still better but honest + flagged; only the 7 real-IV classes are trustworthy without an options feed.
- Skill: coin-flip-decomposition.md §10 + lessons (cross-instrument IV reliability). 133 tests (+1). v89.
- TODO to make non-index ratings real: a true IV feed (Deribit DVOL for BTC/ETH; ORATS/option chains).

## D85 — Wire real Deribit DVOL for BTC/ETH + harden daily cache (2026-06-07)
- **Ask (user):** wire DVOL (Deribit's real 30-day implied-vol index for BTC/ETH) so crypto rows use a
  TRUE option premium instead of the IV=realized proxy.
- **Built:** `data.fetch_dvol(currency)` — public Deribit `get_volatility_index_data` (resolution 1D,
  paged, cached); returns daily DVOL as a fraction. `vol.build`: BTC*/ETH* tickers (via `_dvol_currency`)
  now build `VolModel(label="index:dvol-BTC/ETH")` from DVOL when iv_source∈{auto,vix,index} → pi_coin
  flags them `iv_is_real=True` (no VRP haircut). Graceful fallthrough to realized if Deribit unreachable.
- **The reveal (real IV flips the verdict):** crypto vol is RICH, not cheap. ETH IV ~75%, BTC ~62% (vs
  realized → RV/IV 0.73/0.68). So as a long STRADDLE, ETH p_net 0.31, BTC 0.26, SPY 0.37 — all mediocre,
  all carry the VRP. ETH/BTC's ПИ case rests ENTIRELY on the scalp (need c*≈0.57–0.66), exactly the guru's
  "ETH wins on the scalp, not cheap vol." The earlier proxy "ETH 0.75" was pure artifact.
- **Cache bug fixed:** found ETH-USD daily cached as only 86 rows (a recent-start fetch poisoned the
  cache). Hardened `fetch()` to ALWAYS download deep history (dl_start=1990) regardless of requested
  `start`; `_slice` serves the window. Cleared the container cache volume on deploy so poisoned entries
  rebuild deep. 134 tests (+1 dvol mapping). assets v90.

## D86 — Tab 14 «Симуляция в деньгах»: one ПИ construction, one period, every figure in dollars (2026-06-09)
- **Ask (user):** an interactive, real-life simulation of the ПИ strategy in CONCRETE money — take $10k,
  show what to buy, what the straddle costs, what the scalp brings, run it over a real past window; not
  just for ETH but for ANY instrument, going forward.
- **Built:** `pi_sim.py` (`simulate`) + `/api/pi-sim` + Tab 14 frontend. ONE synthetic straddle (2C−1F)
  held ONE period, every number exposed: entry snapshot (spot, ATM K, BS call/put off the REAL vol
  surface — DVOL for BTC/ETH), sizing (premium budget = risk%·deposit = max loss; M units → 2M calls /
  M short futures), three-thirds scalp limit, the EXPONENTIAL grid in real prices, straddle-core P&L
  (M·|S_T−S0| − premium), and the scalp.
- **Scalp honesty (the crux):** crypto (BTC/ETH/SOL) → scalp is MEASURED by walking the FREE Binance 1m
  path (`measure_scalp_1m`, mirrors the Tab-8 grid: response orders, carry stuck parts, Bollinger
  flat-gate «don't fade a galloping market»). Non-crypto → labelled capture SCENARIO (daily bars can't
  see intraday round-trips, INVARIANT #5). Grid sized INTRADAY (`grid_atr_frac≈0.05`) so 1m hits doctrine
  cadence (INVARIANT #7) — a wide ×0.5 daily-ATR grid barely trades on 1m (2 RTs vs ~100).
- **Accounting fix (caught mid-build):** total_net = straddle_net + scalp_realized + scalp_open_mtm. In a
  TREND the counter-trend scalp's stuck legs mark NEGATIVE (INVARIANT #3 — scalp bleeds, gamma wins);
  excluding that overstated the result. The flat-gate cut ETH-Aug-2025 stuck bleed −$1011→−$792.
- **The reveal (ETH Aug 2025, $10k, 10% risk):** spot $3.5k→$4.4k (+26%) BUT IV was 70% → breakeven ±16%,
  so the costly straddle netted only +$588; counter-trend scalp booked +$163 (16% of theta) yet stuck
  shorts gave back −$792 → total ≈ −$41 (≈flat). Honest lesson: a strong one-way TREND is NOT the scalp's
  friend; ПИ pays in a FLAT (scalp covers theta) or on a move bigger than the (expensive) breakeven.
- 140 tests (+6: OU-reversion scalp>0, loss-cap, sizing identities, exponential grid, trend bleed). v91.

## D87 — Tab 14 honesty pass: scalp BAND (not one number) + payoff-tilt graph + look-ahead fix (2026-06-09)
- **Ask (user):** is the QQQ scalp (+$573, 57% theta) conservative/realistic? detail how it's estimated;
  and add a graph showing the straddle «перекошен» by the scalp futures.
- **Judged it — it was OPTIMISTIC, not conservative.** Decomposition: scenario = capture×Σ(daily range)×
  limit applies the FULL 5-part limit to EVERY day's range with ZERO losing days. Proof: measuring the
  SAME grid on real 60m bars gave $35 (3% theta, 14 RTs — hourly undercounts the fine grid); our one hard
  1m calibration (ETH) booked ~16%; Korovin's own figure is 10–15% of premium/mo. So +$573 (57%) is ~3×
  hot.
- **Fix — scalp as a BAND, conservative headline:** `scalp_floor` (measured on real bars: 1m crypto = REAL
  & the headline; 60m else = undercounting floor), `scalp_realistic` = coverage_anchor×theta (the
  vol-invariant primitive, INV #7; default 0.15 from ETH-1m+guru) = the NON-crypto headline, `scalp_scenario`
  = optimistic ceiling. QQQ now reads $35 floor → $150 realistic (headline) → $573 ceiling, total −$287 (was
  the rosy +$136).
- **Payoff-tilt graph (`_payoff_curves`):** terminal P&L vs S_T — the symmetric straddle V (M·|S−S0|−prem)
  vs the scalp-futures-TILTED V (+q·(S−S0)). Measured runs draw the ACTUAL net stuck lots (ETH: net −1.17,
  bearish tilt); unmeasured draw the ±limit ENVELOPE. `measure_scalp_1m` now also returns signed net_lots.
- **Look-ahead bug fixed:** endpoint fetched daily from `start`, so entry-day ATR fell back to the whole
  FUTURE period (QQQ ATR $11.97 → $5.87 trailing). Now fetches with warm-up history; ATR/realized-vol use
  only prior bars.
- 142 tests (+2: anchor headline, payoff envelope skew). assets v92.

## D88 — Tab 14 «есть ли edge?»: scan ALL instruments, rolling months, real-core distribution (2026-06-09)
- **Ask (user):** add a button to run it on ALL instruments + an average straddle graph → is there an edge?
- **Built:** `pi_sim.rolling_edge()` (non-overlapping monthly windows, aggregates straddle CORE = M·|move|
  − premium [REAL: prices + IV] and total = core + anchor·premium; `c_star` = coverage to break core even)
  + `/api/pi-sim/scan` (whole catalog) + Tab 14 scan button, edge BAR chart (core $/mo per instrument),
  pooled straddle-core HISTOGRAM (the «average straddle» shape), ranking table.
- **Reliability gate (caught a fake result):** new-listing crypto (OP/ARB, rv/iv=111×) priced off a tiny
  trailing-vol proxy gave absurd "$374k/mo edge". Flag `reliable = iv_is_real or (rv/iv≤3 and |core|≤deposit)`;
  artifacts excluded from ranking + pooled, kept (flagged) at the table bottom. Lead with the MEDIAN, not the
  outlier-dominated mean.
- **The verdict (real-IV instruments, 2019–2025):** long straddle alone BLEEDS in the median (VRP, IV≥RV):
  SPY core −$277/mo (c*≈0.28), gold −$210 (0.21), QQQ −$204 (0.20), oil −$112…−$185 (0.11–0.18), indices
  worse. ONLY ETH/BTC show core>0 (RV>IV — crypto's real movement). Pooled core: median negative, mean pulled
  up by a thin convex right tail (asymmetric payoff). ⇒ NO edge from long-vol per se; edge needs RV>IV (crypto)
  OR the scalp to actually cover theta — and the scalp is honestly measurable only on crypto 1m. Matches Tab 13.
- 143 tests (+1 rolling_edge: flat→c*=1.0 & «нет edge», trender→core>0 & c*≤0). assets v93.

## D89 — Tab 14 ADAPTIVE CHOP-SCALP model (the trader's manual-range know-how) (2026-06-09)
- **Ask (user):** the sharp-move (gamma) part is clear; model the CHOP part. In chop (~⅔ of time) the trader
  READS the realized flat and re-sizes the grid — takes ~50% of each swing (0.05 of a 0.10 band), ~10 trades/
  day, re-adjusting as the band widens (0.10→0.30 → next working part, TP 0.15). Build a conservative,
  mathematically-correct model conditional on that manual adjustment.
- **Built `pi_sim.chop_coverage_model`:** `scalp = n_days·f_chop·trades_per_day·(eff·flat_frac·daily_range)·
  part_lots`, coverage = scalp/theta. VOL-INVARIANT (INV #7): flat_width ∝ σS, part_lots ∝ premium/σS ⇒
  product ∝ premium ⇒ coverage = f(trades/day × eff × flat_frac × f_chop), not the instrument's vol. Defaults
  f_chop=0.667, trades=10/day, eff=0.5, flat_frac=0.25 → ~37–56% coverage; flat_frac 0.4 → ~60%; 0.5+ →
  self-pays. This REPLACES the flat 15% anchor as the realistic headline.
- **Grounded in real data (`measure_chop_diag`):** per-day range / intraday PATH (Σ|Δ|) / efficiency-ratio
  chop classifier + a FEASIBILITY check (real path ≥ path the cadence needs) — trusted only on true 1m (60m
  undercounts the path). ETH-Aug-2025: chop 100% of days, path ×16.5 range, 10 trades/day feasible ×8.76.
- **The reveal (answers «is chop plausible»):** for ETH the FIXED 1m grid bled −$759 (stuck on the trend),
  but the ADAPTIVE chop model = +$1094 (109% theta) and the real path VALIDATES it → the $1,853 gap is the
  value of manual re-centering vs «поставил-и-забыл». So YES: in chop, 10 trades/day at 50%-of-a-local-flat
  plausibly covers — even exceeds — the theta, and it's vol-invariant so it transfers across instruments.

## D90 — Tab 14: NET of working parts + use MEASURED chop fraction (user caught the gap) (2026-06-09)
- **User caught it:** on SPY +3.75% the chop model headlined +$387 but never netted the WORKING PARTS — the
  grid sold at 622/622.5/623.3/624.8 and price ran to 645, so those parts are stranded short. Also «straddle
  not in plus though price went 621.72→645.05» — correct: +3.75% < the 5.03% breakeven (premium=2·c0=$31 at
  20% IV) ⇒ the straddle loses; a big-LOOKING move still isn't enough at 20% vol. Not a bug — explained.
- **Fixes:** (1) chop income now uses the MEASURED chop-day fraction (`income_effective`), not assumed ⅔ —
  trending months auto-deflate (SPY 44% → $258 vs $387). (2) NET the stranded parts: `scalp_realistic =
  income_effective + min(0, stuck)`. `stuck` = the MEASURED open-leg mark (gate-managed, 1m/60m) when
  available, else `_stuck_drag_fixed(grid,S0,S_T)` (fixed-grid upper bound). SPY: fixed grid would strand
  −$448 (the user's worry, confirmed), but with the flat-gate the measured drag ≈ $0 → net scalp $258, total
  ≈ flat (+$4, was +$133). The gate («don't fade the breakout») is exactly what saves the parts — both shown.
