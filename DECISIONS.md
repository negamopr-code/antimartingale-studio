# DECISIONS — antimartingal studio

Running log of design decisions. Read before structural edits.

- **D1 (2026-05-29)** — Scope = abstract antimartingale + real-asset ATR port + options view,
  NOT Black-Scholes LEAPS pricing engine (LEAPS plan `bright-weaving-marshmallow.md` superseded).
- **D2** — Win/loss resolution = **weekly entry + daily intra-week race**, barriers **fixed at
  entry** (B-1), single-day straddle = **loss-first** (B-2). Resolves the A-vs-B ambiguity.
- **D3** — Data: daily from yfinance (stooq fallback), weekly via resample. Daily is the finest
  interval with full free history; intraday windows too short for multi-decade backtest.
- **D4** — Account model = **cash + optional cap** (`cap_mult`), not margin (Q3).
- **D5** — Tab 3 options: **configurable DTE** (slider, default 365), strike chosen by
  **target delta** (default 0.95, deep-ITM), IV = **realized volatility** of the asset.
- **D6** — Sizing: 1·ATR move == `base_bet`. Linear tab: win=+bet, loss=−bet. Options tab:
  `units = bet/ATR`, P&L from BS reprice; premium floor truncates the left tail (the doctrine's
  loss-side lever → +EV vs the linear instrument).
- **D7** — Cache via **pickle** (no pyarrow/parquet engine dependency).
- **D8** — `resolve_trials` advances to the next week by **week-start date**, not the Friday
  label (fixed an infinite-loop bug where the current week's label > the in-week exit date).

## Web / deployment / TradingView (2026-05-29)
- **D9** — Web stack = **FastAPI (JSON API) + static Plotly SPA**, not Streamlit/Dash (user choice).
  Math core stays transport-agnostic; web layer only adds transport/validation/serialization.
- **D10** — Deploy = **Docker, maximally portable** (no platform lock-in): `deploy/Dockerfile`
  (lean `requirements-web.txt`, non-root, gunicorn+uvicorn workers, healthcheck) +
  `docker-compose.yml`. Platform configs (render/fly) deferred until a target is chosen.
- **D11** — **Stateless** API → horizontal scale by replicas; `WEB_CONCURRENCY` for workers.
  Shared state behind interfaces: `SignalStore` (SQLite→Postgres), price cache (pickle→Redis).
- **D12** — **TradingView seam**: a strategy is a *signal generator*; we overlay antimartingale
  sizing. `tradingview.parse_alert` → `signals.SignalStore` → `signals_to_trials` → `run_linear`.
  Webhook `/api/webhook/tradingview` authed by `ANTIMG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (header or body passphrase).
- **D13** — Signal classification: alert `outcome`=win/loss, or sign of `pnl`. Entry/exit pairing
  of separate alerts = future extension (noted in `signals.py`).
- **D14** — Anti-DoS caps in `web/config.py` (max_iterations, max_target_streak, max_points
  downsampling), all env-tunable. Series downsampled so 30y daily history is a light payload.

## Mirror-hedge (rejected, see SKILL.md)
Antimartingale-long + martingale-short on the SAME instrument resizes in lockstep
(`bet_long ≡ bet_short`) ⇒ net exposure 0 ⇒ deterministic zero gross, costs make it negative.
Not implemented; documented as a rejected tactic.

## Cost model + cost-as-probability (2026-05-29)
- **D15** — Transaction costs: BOTH commission and slippage are **% of position notional
  per fill, charged on entry AND exit (×2 round-trip)**; notional=(bet/ATR)*price.
  (Superseded the earlier $/fill commission + `slippage_frac` model — user wanted both in %.)
  Tracked as separate cumulative curves (commission, slippage, total) plotted on the equity
  chart on a SECONDARY axis alongside net vs gross equity.
- **D16** — Cost expressed as a win-probability drag Δp via the breakeven shift:
  no-cost breakeven p=0.5; with avg cost κ/cycle, (2p*)^N = 1+κ/b ⇒ p*=0.5·(1+κ/b)^(1/N).
  Δp=p*−0.5 = "how much win-prob the cost eats"; if edge (p−0.5) < Δp the strategy is net −EV.
  Reported per-component (commission/slippage) and total; UI shows a ✓/✗ verdict vs the edge.

## Options resolution fixed: no stop + per-trial table (2026-05-29)
- **D17** — A LONG CALL has **no −1·ATR stop** (downside = premium). New
  `resolve_trials_long_call`: hold through pullbacks; WIN = price reaches +1·ATR before
  expiry, LOSS = expiry (entry+DTE) without the target. The options tab uses THIS, not the
  linear whipsaw stops. Demonstrated: SPY 2010–2026 linear p≈0.58 vs option p≈0.98 — the
  call captures the up-move far more often (the whole point the user flagged).
- **D18** — Detailed per-trial table under both backtest charts (`res.table`): entry/exit,
  prices, ATR, barriers/target, exit reason, outcome, bet/cost/pnl/bank; options add strike,
  premium in/out, delta in/out, units, option P&L. Static assets versioned (?v=N) + no-cache
  on the app shell so redeploys are always picked up.
